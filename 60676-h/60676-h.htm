<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br /><br />
HIS TITLE.
</h3>

<p>
It was a beautiful spring afternoon in the northern
hill districts of Tasmania.  The sky was of a bird's
egg blue, which even Italy cannot rival, and the
bold outline of hills which bounded the horizon,
bush clad to the top, showed a still deeper azure
blue in an atmosphere which, clear as the heaven
above, had never a suggestion of hardness.
Removed some half-mile from the little township of
Wallaroo lay a farm homestead nestling against the
side of the hill, protected behind by a belt of trees
from the keen, strong mountain winds, and
surrounded by a rough wood paling; but the broad
verandah in the front lay open to the sunshine,
and even in winter could often be used as the family
dining-room.  The garden below it was a mass of
flowers for at least six months in the year, and there
was scarcely a month when there was a total absence
of them.
</p>

<p>
The house, one-storied and built of wood like all
the houses in the country districts, was in the
middle of the home paddock; the drive up to it
little more than a cart track across the field, which
was divided from the farm road which skirted it by
a fence of tree trunks, rough hewn and laid one
on the top of the other.  A strong gate guarded
the entrance, and on it sat Jack, the Englishman,
his bare, brown feet clinging to one of the lower
bars, his firmly set head thrown back a little
on his broad shoulders as he rolled out "Rule
Britannia" from his lusty lungs.  Many and various
were the games he had played in the paddock this
afternoon, but pretending things by yourself palls
after a time, and Jack had sought his favourite
perch upon the gate and employed the spare
interval in practising the song which father had taught
him on the occasion of his last visit.  He must
have it quite perfect by the time father came again.
It was that father, an English naval captain, from
whom Jack claimed his title of "Jack, the Englishman,"
by which he was universally known in the
little township, and yet the little boy, in his seven
years of life, had known no other home than his
grandfather's pretty homestead.
</p>

<p>
"But o' course, if father's English, I must be
English too.  You can't be different from your
father," Jack had said so often that the neighbours
first laughed, and then accepted him at his own
valuation, and gave him the nickname of which he
was so proud.
</p>

<p>
About the mother who had died when he was
born, Jack never troubled his little head; two
figures loomed large upon his childish horizon,
Aunt Betty and father.  Aunts and mothers stood
about on a level in Jack's mind; it never suggested
itself to him to be envious of the boys who had
mothers instead of aunts, for Aunt Betty wrapped
him round with a love so tender and wholesome,
that the want of a mother had never made itself
felt, but father stood first of all in his childish
affection.
</p>

<p>
It was more than eight years since Lieutenant
Stephens had come out from England in the
man-o'-war which was to represent the English navy in
Australian waters, and at Adelaide he had met
Mary Treherne, a pretty Tasmanian girl, still in
her teens, who was visiting relations there.  It was
a case of love at first sight with the young couple,
who were married after a very short engagement.
Then, whilst her husband's ship was sent cruising to
northern seas, Mary came back to her parents, and
there had given birth to her little son, dying, poor
child, before her devoted husband could get back
to her.  Since then Lieutenant Stephens had received
his promotion to Captain, and had occupied some
naval post in the Australian Commonwealth, but
his boy, at Betty Treherne's urgent request, had
been left at the farm, where he led as happy and
healthful an existence as a child could have.  The
eras in his life were his father's visits, which were
often long months apart, and as each arrival was
a living joy, so each departure was grief so sore that
it took all little Jack's manhood not to cry his heart
out.
</p>

<p>
"Some day&mdash;some day," he had said wistfully
on the last occasion, "when I'm a big boy you'll
take me with you," and his father had nodded
acquiescence.
</p>

<p>
"It's not quite impossible that when I'm called
back to England, I may take you over with me and
put you to school there, but that is in the far future."
</p>

<p>
"How far?" Jack asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"That's more than I can tell; years hence very
likely."
</p>

<p>
But even that distant hope relieved the tension
of the big knot in Jack's throat, and made him
smile bravely as father climbed to the top of the
crazy coach that was to carry him to the station
some eight miles away.
</p>

<p>
From that time forward, Jack insisted that Aunt
Betty should measure him every month to see if
he had grown a little.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you in such a hurry to grow up?"
she asked, smiling at him one day.  "You won't
seem like my little boy any more when you get
into trousers."
</p>

<p>
"But I shall be father's big boy," was the quick
rejoinder, "and he'll take me with him to England
when he goes.  Did he tell you?"
</p>

<p>
Aunt Betty drew a hard breath, and paled a
little.
</p>

<p>
"That can't be for years and years," she said
decidedly.
</p>

<p>
"He said when I'm big, so I want to grow big
in a hurry," went on Jack, all unconscious how his
frank outspokenness cut his aunt like a knife.  Then
he turned and saw tears in her pretty eyes, and flew
to kiss them away.
</p>

<p>
"But why are you crying, Aunt Betty?  I've
not been a naughty boy," he said, reminiscent that
on the occasion of his one and only lie, the enormity
of his sin had been brought home to him by the
fact that Aunt Betty had cried.
</p>

<p>
She stooped and kissed him now with a little
smile.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't like the day when you go away with
father."
</p>

<p>
"But o' course you'll come along with us," he
said, as a kind of happy afterthought, and there
they both left it.
</p>

<p>
And now Aunt Betty's clear voice came calling
down the paddock.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, Jack, it's time you came in to get tidy
for tea," but Jack's head was bent a little forward,
his eyes were intently fixed upon a man's figure
that came walking swiftly and strongly up the
green lane from the township, and with a shrill
whoop of triumph he sprang from his perch, and
went bounding towards the newcomer.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Betty, Aunt Betty," he flung back over
his shoulder, "it's father, father come to see me,"
and the next minute he was folded close to the
captain's breast, and lifted on to his shoulder, a
little boy all grubby with his play, but as happy and
joyful as any child in the island.
</p>

<p>
And across the paddock came Aunt Betty, fresh
as the spring day in her blue print gown, and
advancing more slowly behind came Mr. and
Mrs. Treherne.
</p>

<p>
"A surprise visit, Father Jack, but none the less
a welcome one," said Mr. Treherne.  He was a
typical Tasmanian farmer with his rough clothes
and slouch hat, but a kindly contentment shone out
of his true blue eyes, and he had an almost patriarchal
simplicity of manner.  He bore a high name in all
the country-side for uprightness of character, and
was any neighbour in trouble Treherne was the
man to turn to for counsel and help.  And his wife
was a help-meet indeed, a bustling active little
woman, who made light of reverses and much of
every joy.  The loss of her eldest daughter had
been the sharpest of her sorrows, and the gradual
drifting of her four sons to different parts of the
colony where competition was keener and money
made faster than in "sleepy hollow," as Tasmania
is nicknamed by the bustling Australians.  There
was only one left now to help father with the farm,
Ted and Betty out of a family of seven!
</p>

<p>
But still Mrs. Treherne asserted confidently that
the joys of life far outweighed its sorrows.
Perfectly happy in her own married life, her heart had
gone out in tenderest pity to the young Lieutenant
so early left a widower, and a deep bond of affection
existed between the two.  She took one of his
hands between her own, and beamed welcome upon
him.
</p>

<p>
"It's good luck that brings you again so soon."
</p>

<p>
"It's a matter of business that I've come to talk
over with you all, but it can wait until after supper.
I'm as hungry as a hunter.  I came straight on
from Burnie without waiting to get a meal."
</p>

<p>
"If you had wired, you should have had a clean
son to welcome you," said Betty.  "Climb down,
Jack, and come with me and be scrubbed.  Don't
wait for us, mother.  The tea is all ready to come
in."
</p>

<p>
Jack chattered away in wildest excitement whilst
Aunt Betty scrubbed and combed, but Betty's
heart was thumping painfully, and she answered
the boy at random, wondering greatly if the business
Father Jack talked about implied a visit to England,
and whether he would want to take his little son
with him.
</p>

<p>
"He has the right! of course he has the right,"
she thought.  "Aunts are only useful to fill up
gaps," and her arms closed round little Jack with a
yearning hug.
</p>

<p>
"There! now you're a son to be proud of, such
a nice clean little boy smelling of starch and soap,"
she said merrily, with a final adjustment of the tie
of his white sailor suit, and they went down to tea
hand in hand, to tea laid in the verandah, with a
glimpse in the west of the sun sinking towards its
setting in a sky barred with green and purple and
gold.
</p>

<p>
Little Jack sat by his father, listening to every
word he said, and directly tea was ended climbed
again on to his knee and imperatively demanded a
story.  It was the regular routine when Father Jack
paid a visit.
</p>

<p>
"And what is it to be?" asked the captain
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jack, the Giant Killer, or Jack and the
Beanstalk.  I love the stories about Jacks best of
all, because Aunt Betty says the Jacks are the
people who do things, and she says you and all the
brave sailors are called Jack Tars, and that I'm to
grow up big and brave like you, father."
</p>

<p>
The Captain's arm tightened round his son.
</p>

<p>
"It's very kind of Aunt Betty to say such good
things about the Jacks of the world.  We must try
and deserve them, you and I.  Well, now, I'm going
to tell you a sort of new version of Jack, the Giant
Killer."
</p>

<p>
"What's a new version?" asked Jack, distrustfully.
</p>

<p>
"The same sort of story told in a different way,
and mine is a true story."
</p>

<p>
"Is it written down in a book?  Has it got pictures?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet; I expect it will get written down some
day when it's finished."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't finished," cried Jack in real disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"Wait and listen&mdash;There was once a man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's all wrong," said Jack impatiently.
"It's a boy in the <i>real</i> story."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I tell you mine was a new version?
Now listen and don't interrupt&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Treherne leant back in his chair, listening
with a smile to the argument between father and
son as he smoked his pipe; Mrs. Treherne had gone
off into the house, whilst Betty, after setting the
table afresh for Ted who would be late that evening
as he was bringing home a mob of cattle, seated
herself in the shadow, where she could watch the
Captain and Jack without interruption.
</p>

<p>
"There was once a man," began the Captain
over again, "who looked round the world, and
noticed what a lot of giants had been conquered,
and wondered within himself what was left for him
to do."
</p>

<p>
"No giants he could kill?" asked Jack excitedly,
"Were those others all deaded?"
</p>

<p>
"Not deaded; they were caught and held in
bondage, made to serve their masters, which was
ever so much better than killing them."
</p>

<p>
"What were their names?"
</p>

<p>
"Water was the name of one of them."
</p>

<p>
Jack stirred uneasily.  "Now you're greening
me, father"&mdash;the term was Uncle Ted's.
</p>

<p>
The Captain laughed.  "Didn't I tell you this
was a true story?  Water was so big a giant that
for years and years men looked at it, and did not
try to do much with it.  The great big seas&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I know them," cried Jack.  "Aunt Betty
shows them to me on the map, and we go long
voyages in the puff-puff steamers nearly every
day!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I was just coming to that.  At first men
hollowed out boats out of tree trunks, and rowed
about in them, timidly keeping close to the shore,
and then, as the years rolled on, they grew braver,
and said: 'There's another giant that will help us
in our fight with water.  Let us try and catch the
wind.'  So they built bigger boats, with sails to
them which caught the wind and moved the ships
along without any rowing, and for many, many
years men were very proud of their two great
captive giants, water and wind, and they discovered
many new countries with their wind-driven ships,
and were happy.  But very often the wind failed
them, grew sulky, and would not blow, and then
the ship lay quiet in the midst of the ocean; or
the wind was angry, and blew too strong&mdash;giants
are dangerous when they lose their temper&mdash;and
many a stately ship was upset by the fury of the
wind, and sent to the bottom.  Then men began
to think very seriously what giant they could
conquer that would help them to make the wind more
obedient to their will, so they called in fire to their
aid.  Fire, properly applied, turned water into
steam, and men found that not only ships, but
nearly everything in the world could be worked
through the help of steam."
</p>

<p>
Jack was getting wildly interested in the new
version.  "Oh, but I <i>know</i>," he said, clapping his
hands.  "There's trains, and there's steam rollers;
I love it when they come up here, and there's an
engine comes along and goes from farm to farm
for the threshing, and that's jolly fun for the
threshers all come to dinner, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I see you know a lot about these captive
giants after all," said the Captain, bringing him
back to the point.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, please; it's just like a game," said Jack.
"Perhaps I'll find out some more."
</p>

<p>
"I can't go on much longer.  It would take me
all night to tell you of all the giants we keep hard
at work.  Three are enough to think of at a time.
Tell me their names again for fear you should
forget."
</p>

<p>
"Water&mdash;one.  Wind&mdash;two, and Fire, that makes
steam&mdash;three," said Jack, counting them off, as he
rehearsed them on his father's fingers.  "Just one
more, daddy dear," a phrase he reserved for very
big requests.
</p>

<p>
"One more then, and away you go to bed, for
I see Aunt Betty looking at her watch.  The last
giant that the man of the story very much wishes
to conquer, and has not done it yet, is air.  He wants
to travel in the air faster than any train or
steamship will take you by land or water."
</p>

<p>
"Like my new toy, the one grandmother sent
for on my birthday seven.  She sent for it all the
way to Melbourne, an 'airyplane' she calls it, but
it only goes just across the room, and then comes
flop."
</p>

<p>
"That's just it; at present flying in the air too
often ends in flop, and this man I'm talking of
wants to help to discover something that will make
flying in the air safer and surer.  There are lots of
men all over the world trying to do the same thing.
All the giants I have told you of are too big and
strong for one man to grapple with by himself,
but many men joined together will do it, and the
man of the story has been working at it by himself
for years, and at last&mdash;at last he thinks he has
discovered something that will be of service to
airmen and to his country, and he's going over to
England to test it&mdash;to see if his discovery is really
as good as he believes it to be."
</p>

<p>
Little Jack sat grave and very quiet, pondering
deeply.
</p>

<p>
"What's the man's name, father?  The man
you're telling about."
</p>

<p>
"Jack, a Jack who will be well content if he can
help to do something big in conquering the giant
Air.  It's your father who is the man of the story.
I promised it should be a true one."
</p>

<p>
Jack's answer seemed a little irrelevant.  He
slipped from his father's knee and took his hand,
trying with all his might to pull him up from his chair.
"Come, father, come quick and see how big I've
grown.  Aunt Betty measures me every month,
and says I'm quite a big boy for my age."
</p>

<p>
Wondering at the sudden change of subject, the
Captain humoured his little son, and allowed
himself to be dragged to the hall where, against the
doorpost of one of the rooms, Jack's height was
duly marked with a red pencil.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Betty's right.  You're quite a big boy
for only seven years old."
</p>

<p>
"I knewed it," cried Jack, in rapturous
exultation, "so you'll take me along with you, dear,
and we'll hit at that old giant Air together.  Oh,
I'm so glad, so glad to be big."
</p>

<p>
"Not so fast, sonny," said the Captain, gently
gathering him again into his arms.  "You're a big
boy for seven years old, but you're altogether too
young for me to take you to England yet."
</p>

<p>
Jack's face went white as the sailor suit he wore,
and his great round eyes filled to the brim with
tears, but by vigorous blinking he prevented them
from falling down his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"You said&mdash;perhaps when I was big you'd take
me with you."
</p>

<p>
"And that will be some years hence when I'll
come back to fetch you, please God."
</p>

<p>
"Me and Aunt Betty, too," said Jack, with a
little catch in his throat, "'cause she'll cry if I
leave her."
</p>

<p>
"Jack, it's bedtime, and you will never go to
sleep if you get so excited," said Aunt Betty
decidedly, feeling all future plans swamped into
nothingness by the greatness of the news Father
Jack had come to tell.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, I'll carry you pig-a-back," said the
Captain, dropping on to all fours.  "Climb up and
hold fast, for the pig feels frisky to-night, and I
can't quite tell what may happen."  So Jack went
off to his cot in Aunt Betty's room in triumph and
screams of laughter, but the laughter gave way to
tears when bathed and night-gowned he knelt by
Aunt Betty's side to say his prayers.  The list of
people God was asked to bless was quite a long
one, including various friends of Jack's in the
township, but last of all to-night came his father's
name.
</p>

<p>
"God bless Father Jack, and make Little Jack
a good boy and very big, please, dear God, so as
he'll soon have father to fetch him home."
</p>

<p>
And then, with choking sobs, Jack sprang to his
feet and into bed.
</p>

<p>
"Tuck me in tight, Aunt Betty, and don't kiss
me, please.  I'll tuck my head under the clothes,
and don't tell father I'm crying.  It's only little
boys who cry, he says, and I want to be big, ever
so big.  I'll grow now, shan't I?  Now I've asked
God about it."
</p>

<p>
Aunt Betty's only answer was a reassuring pat
on his back as she tucked the bedclothes round him.
Truth to tell she was crying a little too.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br /><br />
A CHUM
</h3>

<p>
"You've sprung it upon us rather suddenly, Jack."
</p>

<p>
Betty and her brother-in-law sat in the verandah
in the glory of the Tasmanian night.  The stars
shone out like lamps from the dark vault above
with a brilliancy unknown in our cloudier
atmosphere; a wonderful silence rested on the land,
except that at long intervals a wind came sighing
from the bush-clad hills, precursor of the strong
breeze, sometimes reaching the force of a gale, that
often springs up with the rising of the sun.
</p>

<p>
Jack removed his pipe and let it die out before
he answered Betty.
</p>

<p>
"To you I expect it may seem a fad, the result
of a sudden impulse, but really I've been working
towards this end ever since aviation has been
mooted, spending all my spare time and thought
upon the perfecting of a notion too entirely technical
to explain to anyone who does not understand
aeroplanes.  Finally I sent over my invention to
an expert in the Admiralty, with the result that
I've received my recall, and am to work it out.
There is no question that at this juncture, when all
nations are hurrying to get their air fleet afloat,
we are singularly behindhand, and I feel the best
service I can give my country is to help, in however
small a degree, to retrieve our mistake."
</p>

<p>
"You don't really think England is in peril, do
you?"
</p>

<p>
"The unready man is always in peril, and England
is singularly unready for any emergency at the
present time.  I believe with some men the call
of country is the strongest passion in their blood.
For a moment the thought of leaving the little
lad staggered me, for, of course, he's altogether too
young to think of taking him with me.  Nobody
would mother him as you are doing, Betty.  I
would like him to be with you for some years longer
yet, if you agree to continue taking charge of him."
</p>

<p>
"But of course," said Betty, with a little catch
in her throat.  "He is my greatest joy in life.  I
dread the time when I must let him go."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you; I want to leave him here as long
as possible until it becomes a question of education.
Of course I would like if he shows any inclination
that way that he should follow in my footsteps,
either serve in the navy or in the air fleet."
</p>

<p>
Betty gave a little gasp.  "But the peril, Jack!
Think of the lives that have been already sacrificed."
</p>

<p>
Jack shrugged his shoulders.  "By the time the
boy is old enough to think of a profession, I don't
suppose aviation will be much more dangerous
than any other calling that is distinctly combative
in character, and if it is, I hope my son will be
brave enough to face it.  However, what Jack will
be or do when he grows up is too far a cry to discuss
seriously."
</p>

<p>
"And meanwhile what do you want me to do
with him?"
</p>

<p>
"Just what you are doing now.  Bring him up
to fear God and honour the King."
</p>

<p>
"And when education presses?  I can teach
him to read and write and a little arithmetic, but
when he ought to go further?  Am I to send him
away to a boarding school?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not, Betty.  I would almost rather
you let him go to the State school here, and kept
him under your own eye.  I don't believe association
during school hours with all and sundry will
hurt him whilst he has you to come back to, and
the teaching at some of these schools is far more
practical and useful than at many a preparatory school
at home.  What can you tell me of the master here?"
</p>

<p>
"He's rather above the average, and if he finds
a boy interested in his work is often willing to give
him a helping hand.  For one thing, I don't believe
Jack will ever want to be much off the place out
of school hours.  He's a manly little chap, and loves
being about with Ted or father on the farm.  I
wish sometimes he had some chum of his own, a
little brother, or what would be almost as
good&mdash;a little sister.  His play is too solitary."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid it's out of your power or mine to
cure that," said the Captain, rather sadly, his
thoughts going back to the pretty wife who had been
his for so short a time.
</p>

<p>
When little Jack appeared at breakfast the
following morning there was no sign of the previous
night's emotion, but he was quite inseparable from
his father that day, never leaving his side for an
instant if he could help it.  He was much graver
than usual, intent upon watching the Captain's
every movement, even adjusting his own little
shoulders to exactly the same angle as his father's,
and adopting a suspicion of roll in his walk.
</p>

<p>
The Captain was to leave by the evening coach,
and Betty catching the wistful look in little Jack's
eyes suggested that he should be the one to escort
the Captain down the green lane to the hotel in the
township from which the coach started.  Jack,
holding his father's hand tight gripped in his own,
scarcely uttered a word as they walked off together.
He held his head high and swallowed the uncomfortable
knot in his throat.  Not again would he disgrace
his manhood by breaking into tears.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be <i>real</i> big when you come next time," he
ventured at last.  "Will it be soon?"
</p>

<p>
"As soon as I can make it, Jackie.  Meanwhile
you'll be good and do as Aunt Betty tells you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sometimes.  I can't always," said Jack
truthfully.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as often as you can.  And little or big
you'll not forget you're Jack, the Englishman, who'll
speak the truth and be brave and ready to fight
for your country if need be."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Jack, squaring his shoulders a
little.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll write to you from every port&mdash;Aunt
Betty will show you on the map the ports my ship
will touch at&mdash;and when I get home I shall write
to you every week."
</p>

<p>
That promise brought a smile to Jack's twitching
lips.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but that's splendid!  A letter all my own
every week," he said, beginning to jump about with
excitement at the prospect.
</p>

<p>
"Will it have my name written upon the
envelope?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, yes.  How else should the postman know
whom it's for?  You'll have to write to me, you
know."
</p>

<p>
That proposition did not sound quite so delightful,
and Jack's forehead puckered a little.  He
remembered the daily tussle over his copy-book.
</p>

<p>
"I don't write very well just yet," he said.
</p>

<p>
"That will have to be amended, for a letter I
must have every week.  Aunt Betty will guide
your hand at first, and very soon I hope you will be
able to write me a sentence or two all your own,
without Aunt Betty's help."
</p>

<p>
"But what'll I say in a letter?" asked Jack, still
distrustful of his own powers.
</p>

<p>
"Just what you would say to me if you were
talking as you're talking now; how you get on with
your lessons.  If you're a good boy or a bad one, who
you meet, what picnics you have; anything you
like.  What interests you will surely interest me."
</p>

<p>
The thought that father would still talk to him
when he was away kept Jack steady through the
parting, that, and the fact that a young horse only
partially broken in was harnessed to the steady
goer who for months past had been one of the hinder
pair of the four-horse coach, played all manner of
pranks at starting; at first declining to budge at
all; then, when the superior force of the three others
made movement necessary, setting his four legs
together and letting himself be dragged along for a
few paces, finally breaking into a wild gallop which
was checked by his more sober mates, until at last
finding himself over-matched he dropped into the
quick trot of the other three, fretting and foaming
at the mouth, nevertheless, at his enforced obedience.
It was a primitive method of horse-breaking, but
effectual.  And so Jack's farewells to his father
were diversified by watching the antics of the
unbroken colt, and joining a little in the laughter of
the ring of spectators that had gathered round to
see the fun.  But when the final start was made
Jack was conscious of the smarting of unshed tears,
rubbed his eyes vigorously with his sturdy fists
and set off home at a smart trot, standing still
sometimes and curvetting a little in imitation of
the colt that needed breaking in.
</p>

<p>
Betty, who stood waiting for him at the gate of
the paddock, ready to comfort and console, saw
him gambolling along like a frisky horse, and felt
her sympathy a little wasted.  Children's sorrows
are proverbially evanescent, but she was hardly
prepared for Jack to return in such apparently
rollicking spirits from the parting with his father
of indefinite duration.  And when he came up to
her it was of the horse and its capering that he told
her, mimicking its action in his own little person:
holding back, pelting forwards, trying to rear,
interspersed with vicious side kicks, and finally a
wild gallop which sobered into a trot.
</p>

<p>
"That's 'zackly how he went," he said, waiting
breathless for Aunt Betty to catch him
up.
</p>

<p>
Betty was extremely astonished that Jack made
no mention of his father, but later she understood.
Tea was over, and before Jack went to bed Betty
allowed him a quarter of an hour's play at any game
he chose.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to be the frisky horse again,
and I will drive you," she asked, willing to humour
his latest whim.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll get my slate and write, only you must
help me."
</p>

<p>
This was indeed an unexpected development for
Jack, and left Betty speechless.  Jack was quick
at reading and quite good at counting, but writing
was his particular bug-bear.
</p>

<p>
She lifted him on to her lap, and he bent eagerly
over the slate on his knees.
</p>

<p>
"Now, what do you want to write," Betty asked,
taking his right hand in her own firm, strong one.
</p>

<p>
"A letter&mdash;a letter to father.  He's going to write
to me every week.  How do you begin?  He says
I must write every week, same as he does."
</p>

<p>
"All right!  'My dear Father'&mdash;That's the way
to begin."
</p>

<p>
By the time the "r" was reached Jack lifted
a flushed face.
</p>

<p>
"It's awful hard work; I'll never do it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes we will.  We'll write it to-morrow in
your copybook.  Very soon it will come quite easy."
</p>

<p>
And the wish to conquer made Jack comparatively
patient at his writing the following morning.  Lessons
over, he turned out into the paddock as usual to
play, but somehow all zest for play had deserted
him.  The effort to prove himself a man the day
before had a reaction.  Every game, played alone,
lost its flavour.  Hitherto Jack had never been
conscious of the need of a playmate.  His whole
being had been so absorbed in his father that the
looking forward to his visits, the saving up
everything to show him and to tell him, had satisfied
him; but to-day, with that father gone, he floated
about like a rudderless boat, fretful and lonely,
not able to voice his vague longing for something
to happen!  He opened the gate and looked down
the lane.  On the opposite side of the lane was
a tenantless house; the half-acre in which it stood
had never been brought into proper cultivation as
a garden, but the flowers and shrubs which had been
planted haphazard about it had grown now into
tangled confusion, and Jack, when tired of his own
premises, had often run down there, where, crawling
on all-fours through the long grass and shrubs, he
had imagined himself lost in the bush, and great
was his joy when Aunt Betty, not finding him in
the home paddock, would come wandering down
the lane, saying in a clear, distinct tone:
</p>

<p>
"Now where can that little boy have gone?  I'm
afraid, I'm dreadfully afraid, he's lost in the bush!
I wonder if it's possible he can have strayed in here."
</p>

<p>
Then her bright head would be thrust over the
gate, and each time Jack was discovered cowering
from sight there would be a fresh burst of rapture
on the part of the much-distressed aunt and roars
of delighted laughter from Jack.  It was a most
favourite game, but he did not wish to play it to-day.
</p>

<p>
Yet he resented it a little that a bullock-wagon
was drawn to one side of the road, the wagon piled
high with furniture, which was being lifted piece by
piece into the house.  His happy hunting-ground
was to be his no longer, for evidently the house
was to be occupied by a fresh tenant.  Dancing to
and fro with the men who were unlading the dray
was a little girl, her face entirely hidden by a large
sun-bonnet, and the rest of her little person enveloped
in a blue overall, below which came a pair of sturdy
brown legs, scarcely distinguishable from the tan
shoes and socks below.
</p>

<p>
Jack's resentment at the thought of losing his
playground yielded to excitement at the prospect
of a playmate so close at hand, and he crept
cautiously along his side of the lane to obtain a nearer
view of the new-comer, finally taking a seat against
the fence just opposite the house.  It was a minute
or two before the little girl discovered him.  When
she did she crossed the dividing road and stood just
far enough from him to make a quick retreat to
her own premises if a nearer inspection was
unfavourable.  It was almost a baby face that peered
out from the bonnet: round apple cheeks, big
serious eyes, and a halo of dark curls that framed the
forehead.  Her eyes met Jack's for a moment, then
dropped in a sudden attack of shyness, and she
showed signs of running away without speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a bit," said Jack.  "Can't you tell us
your name?"
</p>

<p>
The child drew a step nearer.  "What's yours?"
she said, answering Jack's question by another.
</p>

<p>
"I'm Jack, father's called Jack, too."
</p>

<p>
"I'm Eva, but mummy calls me puss.  Is that
your place?" with a nod towards Jack's home.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you can come and look at it if you like,"
and Jack held out a grubby hand.
</p>

<p>
Eva paused, looked up the lane and down it.
</p>

<p>
"Mummy only lets me play with nice little boys,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Jack, rising and turning back
to go home.  That he was rejected on the score
of not being nice enough to play with puzzled him
rather than annoyed.
</p>

<p>
There was a hasty scuttle after him as Eva ran
to catch him up.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, boy!  I think you's nice!  You's got
booful blue eyes!"
</p>

<p>
Jack turned, laughing merrily.  "You're a funny
little kiddie.  Do you want to come, then?"
</p>

<p>
Eva nodded gravely, thrusting a confident hand
in his.
</p>

<p>
"You're old, a lot older than me," she said,
admiring the agility with which Jack climbed the
top of the gate and pulled back the iron fastening
to let her through.
</p>

<p>
"I'm seven, big for my age, Aunt Betty says, but
I want to be a lot bigger before I'm done with."
</p>

<p>
"I'm six next bufday," Eva announced.  "I
had a bufday last week."
</p>

<p>
"Then you're six now."
</p>

<p>
Eva shook her head vigorously.  "Next bufday,
mummy says."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're only five," said Jack dejectedly.
A baby of five was really too young to play with.
</p>

<p>
"Can you play horses?"
</p>

<p>
"Yus," suddenly smiling into Jack's face.
</p>

<p>
"And cricket?"
</p>

<p>
"Kick it, a ball like this," throwing out her little
foot.  "Yus."
</p>

<p>
"Let's see how you run.  I'll give you quite a
long start, and we'll see which can get to the house
first."
</p>

<p>
Eva's stout legs acquitted themselves so well
that Jack's esteem and respect grew by leaps and
bounds.
</p>

<p>
"You'll do quite well for a chum, after all," he
said as he panted up to her.  "Come along and see
Aunt Betty."
</p>

<p>
Aunt Betty's whereabouts were not difficult to
discover.  Her song rose clear and full as a magpie
as she busied herself in the dairy which adjoined
the house.  The sound of Jack's voice made her
turn from her milk-pans to the doorway which
framed him and his little companion.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jack, who is the little girl?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Her name is Eva, and I've just settled she shall
be my chum," was the decided answer.
</p>

<p>
But Eva, frightened at finding herself quite
away from her own people, threw herself on the
doorstep and hid her face in a fit of sobbing.
</p>

<p>
"I won't be nobody's chum!  Take me home to
mummy," she said.
</p>

<p>
Betty's arms closed round her consolingly.
</p>

<p>
"So I will directly Jack can tell me where mummy
lives," said Betty.  "Come along, Jack, and show
me where to take her."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br /><br />
NEW NEIGHBOURS
</h3>

<p>
A resolute-looking little woman faced Betty as
she crossed the threshold of the door of the new
neighbour.  Betty carefully deposited Eva on one
of the boxes which littered the floor and explained
her presence.
</p>

<p>
"It was kind of you to bring her back.  Pussie
has a sad trick of poking in her nose where she's
not wanted," said Eva's mother; but the child,
restored to confidence, raised indignant protest.
</p>

<p>
"Boy does want me; he wants me for a chum,
mummy, and I think he's nice!  Just look at him."
</p>

<p>
Betty watched the grave little face soften into a
smile as the eyes rested first on Eva and then on
Jack, who stood shyly in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"We are neighbours, then," she said, ignoring
Eva's words.  She was clearly a woman who would
commit herself to no promise that she might not
be able to keep.
</p>

<p>
"My father, Mr. Treherne, owns the farm close
by.  Jack is his little grandson," said Betty simply,
"and I'm his only daughter."
</p>

<p>
"And my name is Kenyon.  Come along, Eva;
we'll leave all this alone until after tea, and when
you're in bed I must straighten things a bit," said
Mrs. Kenyon as Betty turned to go.
</p>

<p>
The voice was tired, and an English voice.  The
speaker, still young, for she certainly was well under
thirty, inspired Betty with the feeling that she had
had a hard fight with the world.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you come back to supper with us?  I
know mother will be glad to see you, and it's hard
to get things comfortable on the first night in a new
house."
</p>

<p>
"Comfortable!" echoed Mrs. Kenyon, with a note
of scorn in her voice.  "It will be days before we
can be that.  The house has been standing empty
for a long time apparently, and needs soap and water
in every corner of it.  I should like to send it to the
wash, but as that can't be done I must wash it
myself, every inch of it.  I took it because it was
cheap!"
</p>

<p>
"Will you come, then," said Betty again.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon.  You'll think English
manners defective, but I'm so tired I can hardly
think of what I'm saying.  No, there is so much to
be done I think I will stay here, thanking you all
the same for asking us."  So Betty said no more, and
taking Jack's hand walked quickly down the road.
Jack chattered all the way about Eva.
</p>

<p>
"D'you think she'll be my chum, Aunt Betty?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll wait and see, Jackie, and don't be in too
great a hurry.  She'll want you all the more if you
don't seem too keen to have her," answered Betty,
smiling, giving the little boy his first lesson in
worldly wisdom.
</p>

<p>
But the thought of the tired face haunted kind
Betty as she sat down to supper.  She told her
mother something of the new neighbour.
</p>

<p>
"She's such a decided, determined look and
manner, mother.  She's been pretty, and she's
rather pretty still, only her face has grown hard, as
if she'd had a lot of trouble.  She's young to be a
widow."
</p>

<p>
"What makes you think she's a widow?  She
did not tell you so."
</p>

<p>
"There's no sign of a man about the place; she
clearly has to fend for herself, and to English people
it's hard work.  They're not brought up to be
useful!"
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Treherne laughed.  "She's English, then."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she said so, and she's proud and independent;
but I think when Jack is in bed I'll risk
the chance of a snub, and go and see what I can do
for her."
</p>

<p>
An hour later Betty stood again before Mrs. Kenyon's
door.  From the inner room came a sound
of singing, and through the half-opened door Betty
caught a glimpse of a little bed that stood in the
corner, over which Mrs. Kenyon bent tenderly
soothing Eva to sleep with her soft lullaby.
</p>

<p>
"She has one tender spot in her heart, anyway,"
thought Betty, giving a little cough to proclaim
her presence.  Mrs. Kenyon turned and came toward
her on tip-toe, drawing the door of her bedroom
gently to behind her.
</p>

<p>
"Eva was excited and would not go to sleep.
I don't generally spoil her like that, but she's off
now as sound as a top."
</p>

<p>
"I've come to help you for an hour or two if you
will have me."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kenyon's bright eyes scanned Betty from
head to foot.
</p>

<p>
"It's not everyone that I could accept help
from, but I'll be glad of it from you."
</p>

<p>
So the two worked side by side with a will and
with scarcely a word exchanged between them.
They shifted boxes, placed furniture in temporary
safety against the walls, but to Betty fell the lion's
share of the lifting.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know how you do it; you're as strong
as a man," said Mrs. Kenyon, subsiding into a chair
for a moment's rest.
</p>

<p>
"We're made so out here; for one thing we are
accustomed to use our muscles from the moment
we can walk.  We don't&mdash;have our shoes buttoned
up for us," with a sly glance at her companion.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kenyon gave a short laugh.  "Nor have
I since I came out here.  Since I married I learned
the way to clean them.  That's six years ago, and
for three years I've made the child's living and my
own.  It has not been a bed of roses.  I tried various
methods, was lady-help and so on; but now I'm a
dressmaker, and that not only pays better, but leaves
me free to keep a little home of my own.  I hope
the people in the township need a dressmaker."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed they do if you are willing to work in the
house.  The only woman we can get is engaged weeks
beforehand, and then as often as not fails one at the
last minute.  If you are good I believe you will
hardly have a day free."
</p>

<p>
"That's good hearing, but they must accept Eva
with me.  I can't leave her, you see.  Turn her
into the garden and she is as independent as a puppy.
I think I am good at sewing!  As a girl at home
I made most of my own gowns and was often asked
the name of my dressmaker.  I decided to come
here as someone I met told me there was a good
opening."
</p>

<p>
Betty's eyes rested thoughtfully on the speaker
The dusk gave her courage to express her thought.
</p>

<p>
"I almost wonder you did not go home.  You're
not really fitted for a fight with life."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Kenyon's chin lifted.  "I chose my lot and
will abide by it."
</p>

<p>
Betty knew she had been guilty of an impertinence
in trying to probe beneath the surface, and
rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"You'll go to bed now; you won't try to do
anything more when I'm gone," she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll go to bed chiefly because I must."
</p>

<p>
"And to-morrow won't be a busy day with me;
you'll let me come again?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely yes, and thank you for your kindness.
It's been more than manual help; you've heartened
me up; you're so splendidly happy.  Your very
step has happiness in it.  It must be because you're
so strong."
</p>

<p>
But there Mrs. Kenyon erred, for Betty's happiness
lay rather in the fact that quite unconsciously she
brought happiness to all about her.
</p>

<p>
The next morning Jack, sent on a message to the
township, sauntered leisurely past the opposite side
of the lane from Eva's home, casting one furtive
glance to see if she were anywhere in sight, and then
conscious of a rosy face flattened against the gate,
went on with his eyes held steadily in front of him.
Of course if a little girl did not want to be a big boy's
chum&mdash;Jack was too young to finish the sentiment,
but a lump of disappointment rose to his throat
and a sudden impulse made him take to his heels
and fly, casting never a backward look.
</p>

<p>
He was not long gone, for Aunt Betty's orders had
been peremptory.  She was pressed for time and
there must be no loitering by the way.  He saw that
Eva had pushed open the gate and was wandering
down the lane towards the entrance to the paddock,
a bright spot of colour in her little red overall.  The
green road extended beyond Mr. Treherne's land to
another farm some distance further on, and from
the far end of it Jack saw a young bullock trotting
in Eva's direction.  Quite used to animals and
wholly unafraid of them this usually would not have
been worthy of remark, but he recognised this
animal as dangerous and perfectly unamenable to
training.  Only yesterday he had stood by, an
excited spectator, whilst his grandfather and uncle
had been assisting their neighbour in his efforts to
bring the bullock into subjection, but it had proved
so wild and vicious that it had been driven into a
paddock by itself until its owner could decide what
to do with it.
</p>

<p>
"Best get rid of it," Mr. Treherne advised,
"get rid of it before it gets you into trouble.
The creature is not safe."
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Marks, his neighbour, slept upon the
advice and waked in the morning determined to
act upon it, so he and his son after much difficulty
had succeeded in roping the bullock's horns and
between them were going to lead it down to the
township to the butcher, but as the farmer opened
the gate which led into the lane he relaxed his hold
for a moment and the bullock broke away and was
advancing with rapid trot and lowered horns
towards the tempting spot of colour in front of it.
</p>

<p>
All this Jack took in at a glance and his one thought
was Eva's danger.  There was yet some little distance
between her and the angry beast, and he ran rapidly
towards her shouting as he ran.
</p>

<p>
"Run, Eva, run back home; the bullock isn't safe."
</p>

<p>
The child, startled by the call, looked round, saw
the animal bearing down upon her and with a howl
of terror turned to fly, but her foot tripped in a rut
and she fell face downwards to the ground, roaring
lustily.  There was no time to pick her up and
console her so, little Jack sped past her determined to
put his small person between her and the enemy.
Behind he saw the farmer and his son in hot pursuit.
A moment's delay and the danger would be averted,
but Jack was far too young to argue out the matter
in cool blood.
</p>

<p>
<a id="p35"></a>
All he felt was the necessity of preventing the
bullock from reaching Eva, and the spirit inherited
from his father made him try to shield her.  But
the bullock was dashing towards him with lowered
horns and wild eyes, and Jack with the instinct of
self-preservation raised his arms and threw the parcel
he carried straight at its forehead; the bag broke
with the force of the blow and the flour it contained
came pothering out, blinding and confusing the
angry animal.  For a moment it stayed its onward
course, tossing its head to rid itself of the intolerable
dust, and that moment saved the situation, for
Farmer Marks, who had taken a short cut across
another paddock, came bounding over the fence
with his stock-whip in hand and with a tremendous
shout and resounding crack of his whip, caused the
bullock to turn back and plunge madly towards
the field from which it had escaped.  It was
driven into a far corner, and the gate by which it
had escaped was made doubly fast.
</p>

<p>
"And this afternoon it must be dealt with
if I have to put a bullet into it," said the farmer
to his son, "but upon my word it was a near shave
with the little lad.  I never saw a pluckier stand
in my life."
</p>

<p>
Then he hastened back to see what had happened
to Jack, and was considerably concerned to see
Mrs. Kenyon kneeling on the road by his side, and a grave
fear filled him lest, after all, the beast should have
gored the boy; but nothing more serious had occurred
than that Jack, having nerved himself up to the effort
of turning the animal from its course, had suffered
from nervous collapse and fainted.  Eva, the
danger over, had picked herself up and come trotting
towards him, had caught sight of his closed eyes
and white face and had rushed screaming to the
house to fetch her mother, crying that a great big
bull had rushed at Jack and he was deaded, deaded
in the road, which alarming information had
brought Mrs. Kenyon at full speed to the rescue.
And there Farmer Marks found her chafing the
boy's hands and trying to restore consciousness.
</p>

<p>
"I'll carry him to your place where you can took
after him better," he said, stooping to lift the boy
with rough tenderness, and as he carried him he
told the story of Jack's plucky defence of the child
that was smaller than he.
</p>

<p>
"You may blame me," he said, "as I should have
blamed myself to my dying day if anything had
happened to either of them, but after all the thing
was an accident.  I was acting on Treherne's
advice and taking the creature to be put out of
harm's way.  That it broke from me so suddenly
was scarcely my fault.  I can only assure you it
won't happen again."
</p>

<p>
"I'm much too thankful a woman to blame anyone,"
said Mrs. Kenyon, her bright eyes dimmed with
tears.  "He's coming to, I think; leave him to
me, and will you let the Trehernes know that he is
here and safe?"
</p>

<p>
Jack's eyes opened and he looked round him
with a puzzled air.
</p>

<p>
"What's happened?  Where's Aunt Betty?  I'm
all wet," he said.
</p>

<p>
"It's only a little water I sprinkled on your face,"
answered Mrs. Kenyon, seized with an insane desire
to laugh.
</p>

<p>
Then, moved by a passion of emotion that swept
over her like a flood, she took the little boy in her
arms and covered him with kisses.
</p>

<p>
Jack struggled for freedom, not best pleased
with this outburst of affection from a stranger.
</p>

<p>
"I think, please, now I'll get up and go home
to Aunt Betty," he said, but as he spoke the door
opened and Aunt Betty with a halo of ruffled hair
fringing her forehead came towards him, an
undefined fear written in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Jack, Jack, my darling!" was all she said.
</p>

<p>
Jack held out his arms to her, his face all quivering
with the relief of her presence, and to his own great
annoyance began to cry.  The shock to his system
was finding a natural outlet, and he was the only
person that regretted the tears.
</p>

<p>
He was far from feeling a hero as Betty took him
home, for Aunt Betty was always a little vexed
with him when he cried.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to cry; I didn't really.  My
head aches and I feel rather sick.  You don't
think me a baby, Aunt Betty?"
</p>

<p>
Betty's smile was radiant with secret exultation
and pride.
</p>

<p>
"Not a baby a bit, Jack, but a jolly brave little
nipper who can be trusted to look after any little
girl left to his care.  Eva will be chums with you
after this you may be quite sure, and Eva's mother
will feel sure that she will come to no harm with you."
</p>

<p>
She felt Jack fully deserved this amount of praise,
but at the farm very little more was said about the
adventure.
</p>

<p>
"I should hate him to be made into a sort of
hero though he is one," she said to Jack's grandmother.
"There is not one little boy in a hundred
that would have kept his head and known what
to do."
</p>

<p>
So Jack went about the rest of the day a little
whiter and quieter than usual, but when night came,
and Aunt Betty had tucked him into bed after
hearing him say his prayers, he showed some
reluctance to let her go, and for once she humoured
him and sat down by him for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
"It seems&mdash;as if something were rushing at
me," he said, half ashamed to voice his imaginings.
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing rushing at you really.  It's
a trick your tired head is playing on you," said
Betty soothingly.
</p>

<p>
"A great big head with horns and eyes that
burn," went on Jack, "a giant's head."
</p>

<p>
Betty laughed, such a happy contented laugh.
"If a giant at all, Jack, it was like one of the giants
father told you about.  You frightened the big
head more than it frightened you.  Such a funny
thing to do! to throw a bag of flour at the bullock;
throwing dust in its eyes with a vengeance, and by
the time it got over its surprise it turned round
and thought better of it and went back again."
</p>

<p>
It all sounded so simple and wholesome, that Jack
joined in Aunt Betty's laughter.
</p>

<p>
"It was just because I had nothing else to throw.
Do you think father would say I'd frightened a
giant."
</p>

<p>
"He might," said Betty guardedly, "but I know
what I must say, that you must go to sleep as
quickly as you can.  You are a very tired little
boy to-night.  Good night, dear boy.  I'll leave
the door open so that if that naughty head does not
stop aching you can give me a call."
</p>

<p>
"He's not a bit himself to-night; he's just a
bundle of nerves.  I do hope it won't make him
timid in future," she said a little anxiously as she
rejoined the family in the verandah.
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it," said her father, taking his pipe
from his mouth.  "I can tell you from practical
experience it's not a pleasant feeling to see a creature
with horns making a dead set at you.  No wonder
the child is upset, but in the morning he'll forget all
about it."
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Treherne was right.  The only lasting
effect of little Jack's adventure was a grave sense
of responsibility when he and Eva were together,
for she was a girl to be protected and cared for.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
A BUSH BROTHER
</h3>

<p>
It was soon an established fact that the children
spent most of their days together, an intimacy that
at first was rather a trouble to Mrs. Kenyon, who
felt that from mere force of circumstance she could
make no adequate return for the kindness shown
to her little girl at the farm.  Her days were of
necessity spent almost entirely from home, as her
expectation of obtaining work was fully justified.
For half the day, either morning or afternoon, Eva
would go with her, but the other half was almost
invariably spent with Jack, who was always lurking
near the gate in readiness to carry off his playmate.
It was in vain for Betty to assure her that this was
a satisfactory arrangement for both parties, that
before Eva's coming Jack's life had been a lonely one.
</p>

<p>
"It's delightful for the children, but for your
people it must be very often a terrible nuisance;
I must think of some way of making things equal,
or it cannot go on," said Mrs. Kenyon, not many
weeks after her coming.
</p>

<p>
The opportunity presented itself on the first
occasion when Betty brought a message from her
mother, asking if Mrs. Kenyon could reserve the
next week's work for them.
</p>

<p>
"Our sewing is all behindhand, and neither
mother nor I have anything fit to put on, but if you
will devise, fit, and cut out, and we all sit at work
together, I think a week will see us through the
worst of it."
</p>

<p>
"It just happens that I'm free next week, and
I'll come gladly&mdash;as a friend, you understand;
exchange is no robbery.  Think of all you do for
Eva," and Mrs. Kenyon's head lifted with the odd
little gesture that Betty was beginning to interpret
as a sign that her decision on any subject was
final.  Neither did Betty try at the present time
to combat it.
</p>

<p>
But she was not pleased about it.
</p>

<p>
"She's too poor to afford to be so independent,
mother," she said, when she went home.
</p>

<p>
"My dear, let her have her way.  We can make
it up to her in many forms, which she will not detect.
Meanwhile one respects that passionate desire for
independence."
</p>

<p>
"Do you?  Carried too far I think it becomes
almost a vice.  It blocks real friendship.  I should
like to know Mrs. Kenyon's story.  I'm sure she
has one."
</p>

<p>
"When she wishes you to know it she will tell
you," said Betty's mother placidly.
</p>

<p>
The children meanwhile did everything together,
or to speak more accurately, whatever Jack did,
Eva, his faithful satellite, tried to copy.  Happiest of
all was she when, tired with play, Jack would sit
and tell her stories in which his father played
ever a prominent part, and his title in these stories
was always "Father Jack, the Giant Killer," a
name which Eva received with bursts of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't tell you any more if you laugh like
that," said Jack one day.
</p>

<p>
Eva stuffed the corner of her pinafore into her
mouth to stay her unseemly merriment.
</p>

<p>
"But you don't say all that when you see him.
You don't say 'Good morning, father Jack,
the Giant Killer.'"
</p>

<p>
"O' course I don't," said Jack with displeased
dignity, "but this is a story about the giants father
fights.  He really fights giants."
</p>

<p>
Eva's eyes rounded in alarm.  "Does he k-kill
them like your story says?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he catches 'em and makes 'em do what
he wants.  What do you think he's catching
now?"
</p>

<p>
"Goannas," said Eva quickly, whose special
terror were the large lizards called iguanas which
occasionally invaded the garden, or that she and
Jack found about the farm and which Jack drove
away with adorable courage.
</p>

<p>
Jack gave a contemptuous laugh.  "What silly
things girls are!  This is a true story I'm telling
you.  Father catches the air, at least he rides up
in it in a thing called an airy-plane, and he makes
the air help to carry him along."
</p>

<p>
It was neither a very lucid nor accurate description
of his father's methods, but it filled his hearer
with awe and wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Not really!"
</p>

<p>
"But yes," reiterated Jack, "and when I'm old
enough, I'll ride in an airy-plane too.  Come along;
I've told you plenty of stories for to-day.  Let's
come and play airy-planes," so round and round the
paddock scampered the children, with arms
outspread like wings, arms which flapped occasionally
as the speed became greater to the accompaniment
of a whirring sound intended feebly to imitate the
buzz of a motor bicycle.
</p>

<p>
"Faster, faster," cried Jack breathlessly.  "Airy-planes
flies at an awful rate," but Eva's fat legs
were failing her and her arms fell to her side with a
little gasp like the wheeze of exhausted bellows.
</p>

<p>
"Can't&mdash;run&mdash;no&mdash;more," she said, throwing herself
on the grass, and Jack after one more triumphant
circle threw himself by her side.
</p>

<p>
Leaning over the gate with his arms folded on the
top was a man, who had stood there unperceived,
watching the children's play with quiet amusement.
Now as it came to an end he laughed aloud, a kindly
genial laugh.
</p>

<p>
"That was really a fine exhibition," he said
unlatching the gate and coming towards them,
"and deserves a round of applause," and suiting
the action to the word he clapped his hands together
with all his might.
</p>

<p>
Jack sprang to his feet, surveying the stranger
with frankly questioning eyes, but Eva, too
exhausted to speak, sat where she was.
</p>

<p>
"Did you know what we were playing at?
asked Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I must confess I heard you naming it.  You
were pretending to be aeroplanes, weren't you?
but it was so excellent an imitation that I think
I could have guessed.  But isn't it rather a tiring
game for a little girl like this?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; Eva likes to do what I do,
don't you, Eva?"
</p>

<p>
Eva sat bolt upright and nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Your little sister, I expect, and a good deal
younger than you?"
</p>

<p>
"Not sister; we're chums, that's all, but it's just
as good.  She's five, and I'm seven, but I'm big
for my age, aren't I?"
</p>

<p>
The stranger laughed, and seating himself on the
grass, drew Jack down beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Quite big; I thought you might be eight.
Having told me this much I must hear a little more.
I'm getting interested.  May I hear your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Jack&mdash;Jack Stephens; but here they always
call me Jack, the Englishman, 'cause father's a
captain in the English Navy."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I felt somehow that we should be friends.
Shake hands, Jack, the Englishman, for I'm an
Englishman, too.  I've not been long in the colony,"
and Jack's small hand was almost lost in the palm
of his new friend.
</p>

<p>
"And what does the little girl call herself?  I
think she has found breath enough to tell me."
</p>

<p>
Eva lifted a round face dimpled with smiles to
the questioner.  His deep resonant voice and kindly
smile inspired confidence.
</p>

<p>
"Eva," she said.
</p>

<p>
"And the rest?  You must be something besides
Eva," but Eva stood staring at him, not quite
understanding the form in which he had put his question.
Jack gave her a little nudge.  "Tell him, Eva,
that your mother is Mrs. Kenyon."
</p>

<p>
A quick change passed over the face of the
listener; the humour of it resolved itself into an
earnest gravity.
</p>

<p>
"Kenyon!" he repeated quickly.  "It's a name
I know something of.  Do father and mother live
anywhere near here, Eva?  I would rather like to
go and see them, if I might."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't no father," said Eva, with a quick
shake of the head.  "Never had no father.  Mother
lives close by."
</p>

<p>
"Well, come along, Eva.  Just take me to see
mother.  Perhaps she can tell me something of the
Kenyon I am seeking.  Are you called Eva after
mother?"
</p>

<p>
Eva laughed and shook her head.  "No; mother
has a hard name to say.  I can't always say it just
right.  Cla&mdash;Cla&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;rissa," said the strange man, supplying the
missing syllables.  "Is mother's Christian name
Clarissa?"
</p>

<p>
Eva clapped her hands, jumping up and down
with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jack, he's like the conjurer what tells you
things he doesn't ought to know.  Isn't it clever
of him to find out mummy's name?"  But Jack
was intently watching the stranger's face, wondering
greatly why it twitched as if he were in pain.
</p>

<p>
"P'raps he's got the toothache," was his solution
of the difficulty, not knowing that heartache was
the trouble.
</p>

<p>
"Take me to mummy," said the stranger again,
holding out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"We've telled you both our names; you've not
telled us yours."
</p>

<p>
"That will come later; for the present it's enough
for you to know that I'm a bush brother."
</p>

<p>
The children exchanged bewildered glances; the
explanation threw no light upon the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"We don't know what that means," said Jack,
politely.
</p>

<p>
"That, too, I must tell you at some other time;
but now I must get Eva to take me home&mdash;home to
mummy, home to Clarissa Kenyon."
</p>

<p>
Greatly wondering, the trio moved towards the
gate; but there Jack halted.  Some instinct told
him that just now he was not wanted, and much as
he wished to know the end of this strange story, he
determined to go home and wait till he saw Eva
again.
</p>

<p>
He was a little piqued that his new acquaintance
was apparently too much absorbed in his own
thoughts to take any notice of his leaving, but Eva
glanced back with a little nod.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be back directly dinner's over, Jack.  Does
you always walk as fast as this?" she went on,
glancing up at her companion, whose long stride
necessitated a quick trot on her part.
</p>

<p>
"When I'm in a hurry, Eva; and I'm in a hurry
now," and then, dropping the little hot hand he
held, he broke into a run, for coming down the lane
towards them came Eva's mother, returning from a
morning's work to dinner.
</p>

<p>
And then a strange thing happened, for Eva, who
stood stock still with legs set rather far apart, saw
mummy give a start backwards as if half frightened
by something, then heard her break into a little cry,
and the next moment she was caught into the
stranger's arms and held tightly to his breast.  She
did not like such rough treatment!  Eva was
certain she did not like it, for mummy, who never
cried, was sobbing with all her might, great big sobs
as if she were angry or hurt.  So Eva fled forward,
anxious to defend, hammering with all the might of
her young fists upon the assailant's legs.
</p>

<p>
"Let go, let go, you wicked, wicked man," she said.
"Don't you see you are hurting my mummy and
making her cry?  Let go, I say," and the man did
let go, smiling down at the child with eyes that were
full of tears.
</p>

<p>
"You can ask mummy for yourself if I've hurt or
made her glad," he said very gently.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Eva, hush," said Mrs. Kenyon, taking her
little daughter by the hand.  "You don't understand
that I'm crying because I'm glad&mdash;gladder than
I've been for many a year, so glad that it makes me
cry; and all because my brother, your Uncle Tom,
has come to see me; and how he got here and how
he has found me out remains yet to tell.  Come in,
come in, my Tom.  Let us get into the shelter of
the house and let me look at you and make quite
sure that it is in very deed my brother Tom who
talks to me.  But your voice rings true, your dear,
kind voice that I had thought never to hear again."
</p>

<p>
She struggled to the seat in the verandah and
pulled him down beside, gazing into his face with
hungry eyes.  It was bliss enough to look at him
after the long lapse of years, to hold his hand between
her own, which would hardly cover one of his.
</p>

<p>
"You always had such big hands, Tom, such big,
kind hands that seem to carry help and consolation
in their very touch.  Oh, how I've wanted you
sometimes since&mdash;he died."
</p>

<p>
She did not name her husband, but Tom knew well
enough she referred to the father little Eva could not
remember.
</p>

<p>
"But you could have had me for the asking," he
said gently.
</p>

<p>
"I know, I know, but pride would not let me.
How could I appeal to you for help when father and
Walter&mdash;that elder brother of mine&mdash;told me that
in marrying George I made my final choice between
them and him?  And you were away, away in
Canada, and George just about to return to the
colony.  We were madly in love, he and I, so I
married him and came out with him.  I don't say
life was easy, Tom; I don't know whether I did
right or wrong in marrying George, but I do know
this&mdash;that from that day to this I never regretted it.
He was the dearest and best of men, and we were
devoted to each other.  I own that when he got ill
he suffered agonies of self-reproach in having allowed
me to come out with him, but if I had life over
again I should have chosen him before all living
men.  You see father had decided on another match.
George, as he lay dying, tried to make me promise
to go home, but I told him I never would do it, that
I was strong enough and young enough to support
myself and the child."
</p>

<p>
"Young enough, but scarcely strong enough, I
take it," said Tom, slipping his arm round the slight
frame.
</p>

<p>
She crept up closer to him.  "I don't feel young,"
she said.  "The buffeting of life has made me feel
old and cold.  If I could forgive father the part he
played&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, hush," said her brother, "surely you will
forgive him, as God will forgive us all.  Father died
a few months ago."
</p>

<p>
Clarissa drew herself away, stiffening into stony
silence, her hands folded in her lap.  Dead! her
father dead, and she not a moment since speaking
angry, unforgiving words of one who had passed
into the presence of the Great White Throne!  It
was forgiveness for herself that she craved for now,
forgiveness for all the hard thoughts she had
harboured against him since they parted in such hot
anger, forgiveness that in her pride she had made no
effort to break through the barrier of silence built
up between them.  Never a line had she either
written to home or received from it since that hasty
flight of between six and seven years ago.
</p>

<p>
Eva, feeling that matters had passed beyond her
childish ken, had slipped away into the back garden,
and was solacing her loneliness with a game with the
new kitten that they had given her up at the farm,
so the brother and sister were left alone.  Tom
understood something of the conflict that was
passing in his sister's mind and wisely held his peace.
He left her to the teaching of the still small voice
which was making itself heard in her heart with
gentle insistence.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose he never forgave me," she said at last.
</p>

<p>
"I did not hear him mention your name until his
last illness.  Then, when his mind wandered, your
name was often on his lips, showing that you still
held your place in his heart.  He left you an annuity
of £150 a year.  Walter tried his level best to track
you to tell you about it, but up to this time his
search was quite unsuccessful.  We wrote to the
post-office authorities, but they did not help us;
we gave your name to the leading firm of lawyers
in Launceston and Hobart, we advertised in the
local papers, but nothing came of any of our
enquiries.  Then I decided to come and work as a
bush parson in the colonies for some years before
settling down in an English parish, and I thought
it not unlikely that I might find some clue to your
whereabouts, and all in a moment I found you
by the most unlikely means in the world.  I stood
watching two little children playing in a field near
by, went in and made friends with them, and
discovered in one of them my own little niece, who
brought me straight home to mummy.  Some people
may call it a happy chance, but I prefer to regard it
as a direct Providence."
</p>

<p>
"What made you come here at all?"
</p>

<p>
"The fact that your own parson broke down, as
you know, quite suddenly, and was ordered away
for rest; the bishop knew I was at work somewhere
in this neighbourhood, and wrote to ask me if I
could combine my peregrinations in the bush with
Sunday services in this and the other churches
connected with this parish until such time as he
can find a <i>locum</i>.  He is terribly short-handed at
present.  I'm very thankful to be able to give my
services free of charge, for while the bulk of the
property goes with the estate to Walter, my father
has left me a sufficient income to make me
independent of any stipend from the Church.  If I take
an English living at some future period it will be
one with a simply nominal income that a man
without private means could not accept.  At
present I find my nomadic life so absorbingly
interesting that I have no immediate intention of
returning home."
</p>

<p>
"And you will work near here?  How wonderful
and delightful!  What a change one short half-hour
has made in life's outlook.  Poor father!  Did
he leave me that annuity out of pity, do you think?
No, you need not be afraid that I shall refuse it.
My pride is broken down.  It seems a poor thing to
have let it stand between him and me, and now&mdash;I
can't even say I'm sorry."
</p>

<p>
"I forget the exact wording of the will, but I
think it said 'lest she should come to want.'"
</p>

<p>
Clarissa flushed a little.  "I have not wanted,
but it's been a hard struggle, and if my health had
failed"&mdash;her voice broke for a moment.  "But now,
with £150 a year at my back, the worst fear, the one
that has kept me awake at nights sometimes, that
the child would suffer, is entirely taken away.  One
can live the simple life out here, none despising
you."
</p>

<p>
"And you think I shall be content to leave it at
that?"
</p>

<p>
"You will have to be content," and his sister
slipped her hand into his.  "If I needed help at
any time I know you will be glad to give it, but I
chose my own life in marrying my George, and I'll
abide by it.  I've no wish to return to England,
and what will keep me here in comfort would be
grinding poverty at home."
</p>

<p>
"Walter will never consent to your remaining out
here."
</p>

<p>
Clarissa smiled a little sadly.  "He may protest
a little, but in his inmost heart he'll not be sorry to
leave things as they are.  We shall get on quite
nicely fifteen thousand miles apart."
</p>

<p>
A little head peeped round the corner, and a
piteous voice made piteous appeal.
</p>

<p>
"Mummy, I'm not naughty.  Mayn't I have my
dinner, please?  Bush brother can stay if he wants
to."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br /><br />
A CHURCH OFFICIAL
</h3>

<p>
Neither game nor story was needed for the
children's amusement that afternoon.  They sat side
by side on the grass with their heads very close
together discussing the exciting event of the morning,
the strange man's visit and his puzzling profession;
at least Jack was extremely puzzled and not at all
satisfied by Eva's explanation.
</p>

<p>
"He's mummy's brother, don't you see? and
my uncle.  That's what he means when he says
he's a bush brother."
</p>

<p>
Jack shook his head incredulously.  "Mummy's
brother and bush brother can't mean the same,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Pr'aps he calls himself 'bush' 'cause he's got
a beard," Eva suggested.
</p>

<p>
"That's silly!  A bush has got nothing to do
with a beard."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it has," said Eva nodding her head, "birds
build in bushes and they build in beards."
</p>

<p>
Jack fairly screamed with laughter.  "Who's
stuffed you up with that nonsense?"
</p>

<p>
"It's not nonsense," said Eva, almost in tears.
"It's in a book mummy gave me, and there's a
picture of the man and a verse about him too, so it
must be true.  Mummy teached me the verse."
</p>

<p>
"Say it, then," said Jack, mockingly, and Eva
folded her arms behind her plump little person,
knitting her brows in the effort to quicken memory.
</p>

<p>
  "There was an old man with a beard,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who said 'It's just as I feared,<br />
  Two owls and a wren, four larks and a hen<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have <i>all</i> built their nests in my beard.'<br />
</p>

<p>
"THERE!"
</p>

<p>
Only capital letters could express the triumph
of the final exclamation, but Jack laughed louder
and longer than ever.
</p>

<p>
"But it isn't true," he said.
</p>

<p>
"O' course it's true.  It's in a book, and there's
the picture.  Mummy shall show you," reiterated
Eva, stamping her foot.
</p>

<p>
The quarrel promised to be a pretty one, when, all
unperceived, the man whose beard was under
discussion had come into the garden and stood by them.
Eva ran towards him, putting her hand in his.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom, tell him, please.  He won't b'lieve me."
</p>

<p>
"It's all about beards," said Jack.  "Eva says
birds build in 'em same as they do in bushes, and
o' course they don't.  It's just nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"No bird has tried to build in mine at present,"
said Uncle Tom, stroking his thoughtfully.  "What
made you think of such a funny thing, Eva?"
</p>

<p>
It took a minute or two to unravel the thread of
the children's discussion, and Uncle Tom sat
chuckling to himself as they talked.
</p>

<p>
"The simplest way of putting the matter straight
will be to tell you what I mean by calling myself a
bush brother, won't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the children in chorus.
</p>

<p>
"It's neither being mummy's brother nor the
beard I grow that gives me the title&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Jack gave Eva a nudge.
</p>

<p>
"But it's the calling that I've chosen for the
present.  There were a few parsons in England&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! it's parsons who are called bush brothers,
is it?" asked Jack, a little disappointed at so
commonplace an explanation.
</p>

<p>
"No, not all parsons, but just a few of us who
have undertaken a particular kind of work.  We
heard of Englishmen who had emigrated to the
colonies and settled in places very far away from
their fellows, who year after year lived out their
lonely lives never getting a chance to have their
little children baptized, or their sick people visited,
whose Sundays were just spent like other days
because they had no services to go to, so a few of us
banded ourselves together in a sort of brotherhood&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What's that mean?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"A society or company that binds itself together
to do the same work, and the work we brothers put
before us was to come out to the colonies for a few
years and make it our special business to find out
all the lonely settlers in the bush and visit them, and
try to gather them together for little services.  Now
you see why we call ourselves bush brothers: because
our work lies, not in townships and places such as
this, although I am going to be here on Sundays for
a little while whilst your clergyman is away on sick
leave, but we wander from place to place, to all the
most distant homesteads, some of them buried
miles and miles away in the bush."
</p>

<p>
"Does you walk?" asked Eva in her matter-of-fact
fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes I walk and sometimes, when I know
the distance is too great, I hire a horse and ride, and
sometimes the way is hard to find, and I get lost.  I
was lost for two whole days not long ago, and had
to camp out at night without either food or shelter.
I was glad, I can tell you, when I struck the track
again and found myself not far from a farm where
they showed me the greatest kindness.  I spent a
Sunday there, and the farmer and his sons gathered
together a few other people not far away, and we
had service in a barn, and I baptized three little
children that had been born since last a parson had
visited them.  I stayed there for a week, and gave
the children lessons every day, and they were so
pleased and eager to learn, poor mites.  They did
not even know the stories about Jesus when He was
a baby.  It's not often I find children as ignorant
as that, but many of them get very little teaching
about the Bible.  Very often there is not a Bible in
the house.  I don't always have tiny congregations.
Last Sunday I was miles away up there," pointing
to the bush-clad hills which bounded the horizon,
"where there are some large lumber works, and
quite a lot of men are at work there.  So I spent
the few days before in making friends with them,
and asking them to meet me at service on Sunday,
and we had quite a fine service in the open air, and
you should have heard the singing.  It was glorious."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like it ever so much better than going to the
wooden church down here," said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Tom laughed genially.  "Aren't you fond
of going to church, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very; you've got to sit so quiet.  I like
the singing though, and it's not so dull now Eva
comes too."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well; we'll see if you can't learn to like
it better.  Meanwhile, let's have a game before I pay
my respects to your grandfather and grandmother."
</p>

<p>
"Cricket?" cried Jack joyfully.
</p>

<p>
"Capital! it's ever so long since I played a game
of cricket."
</p>

<p>
Betty, as fresh as the morning in her trim white
gown, came out to join the party in the garden, and
Jack hastened to introduce her to his new friend.
</p>

<p>
"Here's Aunt Betty; she'll play too, if you ask
her.  She's a splendid field, and will catch you out
first ball unless you're careful."
</p>

<p>
Betty and Uncle Tom laughed as they shook hands.
</p>

<p>
"I've already made friends with your nephew,
Miss Treherne, and was coming to call on the rest
of you this afternoon, when the children beguiled
me by the way.  Will you really honour us by joining
in our game, though I ask it in fear and trembling
after hearing of your prowess?"
</p>

<p>
"Jack gives me the credit for doing everything
better than anyone else, a reputation I find it
impossible to sustain, but I love to play."
</p>

<p>
A very spirited game followed, which ended
finally in Betty's catching out the parson, to Jack's
unspeakable triumph.
</p>

<p>
"And after your warning, too," he said, throwing
down the bat in comic despair.  "And now I must
pay my call, and then Eva and I must trot home.
My sister said she would be back at six o'clock, and
we must be there to meet her."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad you've come; it will be so lovely
for Mrs. Kenyon to have one of her own relations
with her.  I think she has been very lonely."
</p>

<p>
Uncle Tom turned to the kindling, sympathetic face.
</p>

<p>
"She would have been desolate indeed without
the kindness she has received from you and yours.
It was an unhappy chance that separated us, but
such separation will be impossible again," said Tom
Chance, and that was all the explanation that he felt
it needful to offer or that Betty wished to hear.
</p>

<p>
When Tom and Eva returned at last to the cottage,
the sound that greeted them as they entered was
vigorous scrubbing, interspersed with fitful singing,
and Tom pushed open the door of the inner room
to see his sister on her knees scrubbing the floor
with might and main, until the boards shone again
with whiteness.  He put his arms round her and
swung her to her feet.
</p>

<p>
"How dare you do it, Birdie?  What shall I say
to you for setting to work like that at the end of a
long day's sewing?"
</p>

<p>
The joy of hearing her old pet name, and feeling
the masterful touch of his strong hands, brought
tears to Clarissa's eyes, but a laugh to her lips.
</p>

<p>
"It's so good to hear you talk," she said, bending
back her face to kiss him, "but I was bound to do
it to get the room all fresh and clean for you to-night,
for of course you'll come here to your prophet's
chamber, just a bed and a chair and candlestick.
</p>

<p>
"Betty looked in half-an-hour ago, and wanted
to do the scrubbing, but I would not let her.  That
joy was mine, I told her."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I saw her slip away as I sat chatting with
the old people, but I did not know she was off to
lend you a hand."
</p>

<p>
"Lend a hand! she seems blessed with a dozen
pairs, and they are always busy in helping other
people, notably me.  Had I a sister, she should be
made on Betty's model.  You must not think that
I live in a muddle like this, but a visitor&mdash;and such
a visitor&mdash;has upset the equilibrium of my
establishment.  Tea is laid out in the verandah.  Just
give me a moment to tidy my hair and wash my
hands, and you will see I've not been unmindful of
your creature comforts."
</p>

<p>
And truly, the meal prepared looked dainty and
appetizing.
</p>

<p>
"I should say the catering of this household runs
to extravagance," said her brother, smiling at her.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, for to-night, it's a case of fatted calf, and
besides, I feel money at my back."
</p>

<p>
In clearing away afterwards, Tom showed himself
as handy as any woman.  Washing up plates and
dishes he declared his speciality!
</p>

<p>
"But how did you learn it all?" asked Clarissa,
pausing in her task of drying the things Tom handed
her.
</p>

<p>
"In the same way you have done, by experience.
In the course of my wanderings I have come across
many a young fellow as gently nurtured as I am,
batching in what I call squalor, so my task has been
to put things straight, and keep them tidy and clean,
as far as I knew how to do it.  I think it lowers a
man's self-respect to live in dirt and discomfort, so
when any fellow has put me up for a day or two, I've
tried to repay his hospitality by the labour of my
hands, to make myself worth my keep as I hope to
do here, if you will let me."
</p>

<p>
"But I won't!  My augmented income will allow
me to have a girl in now and again to do the hard
work, and oh! if you knew the joy it is to me to
have someone of my very own to look after again.
Come along, Eva; it's time for bath and bed, and
then, Tom, you and I will sit out in the verandah
and talk."
</p>

<p>
Their conversation lasted far into the night,
albeit desultory in character.  They made no effort
to pick up tangled threads, but Clarissa, nestling
against her brother's side, with his protecting arm
thrown round her, with the star-spangled sky overhead,
and the silence of the night about her, experienced
a sense of peace and happiness that had not
been hers for years.  Her mind went back to the
early days at home, and many a childish reminiscence
was recalled, over which the brother and sister joined
in laughter that had something of pathos in it.
And then she spoke of the first bitter trouble of her
girlhood, the loss of the mother she adored when she
was only twelve years old.
</p>

<p>
"I can't help feeling that if mother had lived, I
never should have come to loggerheads with father.
We both should have acted differently.  He would
have been less hard, and I less stubborn, but it's
curious how the knowledge that he is dead has
changed my own point of view.  To-day I've felt
myself more to blame than he.  I wish I had taken
dear George's advice, and offered to go back.  Even
if he had refused to have me, I should feel now that
I had made some effort towards reconciliation."
</p>

<p>
"He would not have refused," Tom said.  "I
believe he was hungering after you in his inmost
heart, but it's no use going back on the past.  It
only saps your energy for present action.  If you
made a mistake, dear, you've paid for it heavily,
and God in His goodness can make even our
mistakes stepping stones to lead us up to Him."
</p>

<p>
"I don't feel as if I had even begun to climb,"
said Clarissa, in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes," was the reassuring answer, "in your
devotion to husband and child, in your
self-sacrifice, absolute and complete, you must have
drawn nearer to God, whether you knew it or not."
</p>

<p>
Clarissa gave an indrawn sob.  "You were
always such a dear boy, Tom.  You used to pick
me up and console me when I fell, and the falls
were so numerous&mdash;I was such a tom-boy&mdash;and now
you are picking me up after a more serious stumble,
and making me feel as if I shall walk again."
</p>

<p>
"I will run in the way of Thy commandments,"
said Tom, more to himself than to his sister.  "I
always think the man who wrote that led a very
joyous sort of existence, a cheerful sort of fellow
who had given up his whole life to God."
</p>

<p>
"You make religion seem so real, Tom.  You
always did."
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause, and the answer when it
came was spoken from the depth of the man's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Surely&mdash;it's the one great reality; nothing else
matters much."
</p>

<p>
The next day was Saturday, and directly
breakfast was over Tom went down the township to
find the little wooden fabric which represented the
English church.  He got the key from a house near
by and let himself in by a door which had sunk
on its hinges, and opened unwillingly.  There was
no sign of beauty in the barn-like building, and except
that the altar was nicely cared for and had flowers
upon it the whole place filled Tom with a sense of
desolation.  Truly church life in many of these
places needed reformation.  Small wonder that it
took the heart out of many a man who began life
filled with zeal and hopefulness to find himself
with three or four scattered country parishes on
his hands, with people kindly inclined and ever
hospitable, but with narrow means, and whose
church-life from want of fostering had become
almost dead.  To Tom Chance, fresh from the
stirring life of a town parish at home, it seemed as if
it needed a special outpouring of the Holy Ghost
to set the thing in motion, and it was for that he
prayed as he knelt for a few minutes on the
altar-step.  And then a step roused him, a child's step
coming in at the door, and turning he saw his friend
of yesterday, Jack Stephens, with his hands full
of flowers, and a letter carried between his teeth.
He laid down the flowers with due care, took the
letter and turned it over lovingly in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"It's my very own," he said, smiling up at Tom,
"I fetched it from the post office just now.  I
get one every week from father, and I have to
answer it, but my letters are very short and his are
very long."
</p>

<p>
"And the flowers," asked Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they are Aunt Betty's; I bring them down
every Saturday, and she comes presently and puts
them up there," pointing to the altar.
</p>

<p>
"I s'pose I'll have to wait until she comes to
hear my letter."
</p>

<p>
"You can't read it for yourself, then."
</p>

<p>
"Not just all," breaking open the envelope and
unfolding the letter.  "I know the beginning:
'My dearest Jack,' and the end"&mdash;swiftly turning
over the sheet he held and tracing the words with
his finger&mdash;"'Loving father, Jack,' but I can't
read the middles yet.  I s'pose you can read letters
as easily as Aunt Betty."
</p>

<p>
"I expect I can."
</p>

<p>
"Then you could read this to me, and I needn't
wait."
</p>

<p>
"Will Aunt Betty mind, do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Why should she?  There's no secrets in it."
</p>

<p>
So Tom sat down on one of the wooden benches,
and Jack sat beside him, and the letter was read aloud.
</p>

<p>
"Once more, please," said Jack, when it came
to the finish, "and then I shall know all it says."  So
once again Tom read the letter very distinctly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think it's wrong to read father's letter in
church.  He seems such a very good kind of man," said
Tom, as he handed the letter back to Jack's keeping.
</p>

<p>
"Why should it be wrong?" Jack answered
in great astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Because this little house is God's special house,
not to be used for just everyday things; but there are
some letters one likes to read aloud here&mdash;St. Paul's
for example."
</p>

<p>
"I did not know he wrote any," Jack said.
</p>

<p>
Tom took up a Bible and showed Jack some of
the Epistles, explaining to him that the word meant
the same as letter, and Jack grew quite excited and
interested.
</p>

<p>
"And did they come by post same as mine,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"No, there were no posts then; they were all
carried by hand, and we can think of some room
like this quite full of people listening to what the
apostle had written to them.  Such long letters they
were; ever so much longer than father's, with
a number of messages to different people at the
end.  As you grow older, you'll be able to read them
for yourself."
</p>

<p>
It all sounded so real and interesting that Jack
did not in the least realise that he was having a
Bible lesson, and when Betty came in, he ran to
tell her all about it.
</p>

<p>
"So you do the flowers.  I thought them the
prettiest thing in the church."
</p>

<p>
"It's not pretty, and there is no money to make
it pretty," said Betty regretfully.  "We are none
of us well-to-do, and there are not many who seem
to think it matters.  The bell came down a little while
ago, and no one has made any effort to rehang it."
</p>

<p>
Yes, there it lay in the corner of the porch; such
a small bell, and yet it had served to show the church
was alive and at work.
</p>

<p>
"But that seems such a small matter.  Surely
that could be readjusted."
</p>

<p>
"Well, father thought it really did not matter,
for any boy who happens to be here rings it and
pulls it too roughly, and it gets out of order."
</p>

<p>
"But here you have a ready-made bellringer,"
said Tom, looking at Jack.  "Standing upon a hassock,
Jack could quite well ring that little bell, and
he would do it gently and carefully.  I think Jack
must be the bellringer, and I will see about the bell
being put in order to-day.  I think a bell is a good
thing.  It lets people know we are at work."
</p>

<p>
Jack grew crimson with delight.  It made him
feel quite a man that he should be singled out to
ring the bell.
</p>

<p>
"May I, Aunt Betty: May I ring the bell?"
</p>

<p>
"Surely, Jack, if you're man enough."
</p>

<p>
So that afternoon saw Tom at work with a
carpenter he had got hold of in the township,
climbing up to the tiny bell-turret, and getting the
bell once again into position with a brand new
rope hanging inside wherewith to pull it, and on
Sunday Jack awoke with the dawn and talked of
nothing but the honour which was to be his that
day, the office of bell-ringer.  He was to call for
Tom Chance on his way down to the church and
to have his first lesson.
</p>

<p>
Eva was left to follow later with her mother, and
never was boy prouder than Jack when he marched
off, hand-in-hand, with the parson.
</p>

<p>
"S'pose I can't do it," he said with a little gasp
as he entered, pulling off his straw hat.
</p>

<p>
"But you're sure to do it; it's a small bell and
handled gently will be quite easy to ring.  You
may have to stand upon a chair."
</p>

<p>
That Sunday as the congregation dribbled into
church much amusement and some pleasure was
felt at the sight of the grave-faced little boy in a
spotless sailor suit who stood upright as a dart
upon a chair ringing the bell with care and precision,
pink with the importance of his mission.
</p>

<p>
A nod from Tom as he came out of the tiny vestry
in his robes told him when to stop, and he climbed
down to the floor, tied up the rope so that no one
should play with it, and crept to his place by Aunt
Betty's side.
</p>

<p>
"He won't find it dull any more now he has his
own work to do," thought Tom at the end of service,
and Tom was right.
</p>

<p>
There was no keener churchman in the township
than little Jack.

CHAPTER VI
<br /><br />
MINISTERING CHILDREN
</h3>

<p>
Jack's life seemed full of happenings at present,
but the greatest of them was the advent of the bush
brother.  There was really more to tell father than the
page of ruled copy-book paper upon which his weekly
letter was written could compass.  With the stimulus
of that weekly letter his writing progressed by leaps
and bounds, and expression did not seem so difficult
when Aunt Betty told him to try and put down on
paper the very things he would just say to father
were he there to talk to, but it must be owned that
the spelling, even with constant prompting from
Aunt Betty left much to be desired.
</p>

<p>
"ive a chum a little gurl not so big as me we
dus lesuns at wunce, but she nos nothin but her
letters."
</p>

<p>
Then a few weeks later:
</p>

<p>
"a man has cum a parsun, but not like ours hes a
bush bruther and hes tort me ring the bell so now
I go quite erly to church on sunday and ring quite
regler."
</p>

<p>
Betty indulged in many a laugh over the letters
when completed, but to Jack's father they brought
huge delight.
</p>

<p>
Much of what Jack said to father, and father said
to Jack, was confided to Tom Chance at the rare
intervals when the little boy could secure the parson's
attention to himself, for Tom was a busy man and
away for the principal part of every week, either
touring in the bush or visiting the other three parishes,
none less than twelve miles from the township,
that were confided to his temporary care.  Father's
parable about Giants was also passed on in full
with a few embellishments of Jack's own.
</p>

<p>
"A good notion that of father's," said Tom, "a
notion that catches on.  After all the world is just
full of giants that we must subdue to our will.
There's a many-headed giant that we may call Evil
that we've all promised to fight, that we pray
against every day.  Deliver us from evil; everything
that is wicked and bad, and then there's another
giant God suffers in the world, the giant of illness
and bodily suffering, but there are people who are
fighting that with might and main, kind and clever
doctors, such as you have here.  If you want to find
giants to subdue you will have no difficulty in
discovering them."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm going to be just the same as father,"
said Jack sturdily.  "I'm going to be an airman,
same as he."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, time will show," said Tom good-humouredly.
</p>

<p>
That talk had taken place one Sunday as they
went down to church together.  Tom usually made his
re-appearance in the township on Saturday afternoon,
and the moment after their dinner, Jack and Eva
would wander down to the end of the lane and
between their games watch eagerly for his coming.
It was a matter of weekly speculation how he would
arrive, whether walking, or on horseback, or upon a
bicycle.  It all depended upon the distances that he
had to compass during the week, but it made the
watching all the more exciting; but whenever and
however he appeared he was sure of an enthusiastic
welcome from his two devoted adherents.  Although
the vicarage was empty he remained with his
sister, as it did not seem worth while to set up an
establishment of his own for so short a period.
</p>

<p>
On one particular Saturday afternoon when the
time for his appearing was long past, the children's
patience began to ebb.
</p>

<p>
"Don't b'lieve he's coming at all," said Eva
dejectedly.
</p>

<p>
"Lots of things may have happened," Jack
answered, "his bike may have punctured, or his
horse may have cast a shoe, or he may be very
tired and can't walk fast."
</p>

<p>
Jack was prepared for every contingency but the
notion that Tom would not turn up at all, that
would be little short of a calamity, but a prolonged
glance down the road showed something moving in
the far distance.
</p>

<p>
"There's someone on horseback riding beside
a wagon, but I don't think it's Uncle Tom," Jack
continued, for Tom Chance had adopted him as
nephew.  "He's crawling like a snail."
</p>

<p>
But as the wagon drew nearer the outrider was
without doubt their uncle, and Jack raised a shout
of welcome which received no response by word
or look.  The clergyman's face was turned towards
the wagon.
</p>

<p>
"It may be a&mdash;&mdash;funeral," said Jack, under his
breath.  "Uncle Tom looks so solemn and sad."
</p>

<p>
Eva's rosy cheeks paled.  "I think I'm going
home to mummy," she said trotting off down the
lane, but Jack divided between anxiety and curiosity
held his ground.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom, what is it?  Why don't you look
at me?" he said, drawing near as the wagon
approached.
</p>

<p>
"A girl who's very ill; I'm taking her to the
doctor.  Run home now, Jack.  I may see you
later.  If Aunt Betty is about ask her to come
on to the doctor's.  I know she will be of use."
</p>

<p>
Jack took in the situation with one frightened
glance.  The bottom of the wagon was filled with
a mattress and pillows on which a girl of about
thirteen or fourteen was stretched.  Her eyes were
closed and lines of pain were round nose and
mouth, and occasionally a moan of pain broke from
her lips.  Pain was a new experience in his childish
life, and Jack, charged with his message, turned and
fled.
</p>

<p>
He soon found Aunt Betty, and told her about it,
and the next minute she had put on her hat and
was flying by a short cut across the paddock towards
the doctor's house where the wagon had just
arrived.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Wilson gave a pleased nod when he caught
sight of Betty.
</p>

<p>
"Run on, will you, to Mrs. Mason's, just opposite
the church.  She will take in my patient if she has
a bed to spare, and knows the way to look after
them," and Betty with one sympathetic glance at
the pretty face of the sufferer sped on her way.
Mrs. Mason was at home and was able to put a room
at the doctor's disposal, and Betty only waited until
the girl was safely lodged there and to find out if
there were any needs that she and her mother could
supply, before slipping off home again.  She found
the family at supper, but Jack saw the face that
nearly always smiled at him shadowed with anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a bad case, do you think?" her mother asked.
"What is the poor child's name?"
</p>

<p>
"Jessie Butler, and she comes from some back
block behind Wylmington.  The only chance of
saving her life was to bring her right away to the
doctor, so Mr. Chance saw to her removal, but the
doctor thinks badly of her.  It's some injury to her
spine, and he must operate to-night."
</p>

<p>
Jack had laid down his knife and fork, and was
listening with bated breath.
</p>

<p>
"He's so clever, p'raps he'll conquer," he said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Treherne turned with a little smile at the
quaint phrase.
</p>

<p>
"Who told you Dr. Wilson was clever?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom," said Jack flushing a little; the
talk which had led up to the remark he kept to
himself, but of the doctor's victory over pain he
felt fairly confident, although facts seemed against
him.  After supper Betty ran down to Mrs. Kenyon's
to ask for the latest news, but Clarissa could only
tell her that her brother had looked in for a few
minutes to snatch a meal, but had gone again to
his patient who it was feared would not live
throughout the night.  It was not until daylight that he
crept home to get a few hours' rest before his
Sunday work.  Jessie had dropped asleep, and
seemed a little easier.  Jack came as usual to walk
with him to church.
</p>

<p>
"There must be no bell-ringing to-day, Jack,"
said Uncle Tom.  "There is Jessie Butler, the girl
I brought here yesterday, lying very ill just opposite
the church, and we must make no unnecessary noise."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Jack, drawing a deep breath of
disappointment.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure you would not wish to wake her out of
sleep, would you?" said Tom kindly, "but there is
something we can all do for her to-day which may
be of real help to her."
</p>

<p>
"What," asked Jack eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Pray for her at the service.  You listen with
all your ears, and you'll hear her name given, and the
prayers of the congregation will be asked for her and
you must say yours, Jack, say them with all your
heart."
</p>

<p>
"But you said&mdash;you said Dr. Wilson was so
clever that he often conquered pain," said Jack a
little reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
"With God's help, yes!  We none of us can do
anything without it, and it's God's help we are going
to ask for."
</p>

<p>
So Jack's service that morning was just one eager
waiting for the mention of Jessie Butler's name,
and when it came he folded his hands over his eyes
and just said, "Jessie Butler, Jessie Butler," over
and over again.  No other words presented themselves
to his mind, but surely the name so earnestly
repeated reached the listening ear of the good God
to whom he appealed.
</p>

<p>
The next few days were just a tussle between life
and death with Jessie Butler, but life conquered,
and on the fourth day the doctor was able to
pronounce her out of danger.  Her recovery would be
slow and tedious, and she might have to remain
where she was for a great many weeks, but she was
going to live.  Tom had confined his ministrations
to the township during the days of danger, so as
to be near when Jessie asked for him.  He had
taken his share of watching by her bed every night
whilst the crisis lasted, and was as tender and handy
as any woman, Mrs. Mason told the doctor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he's a good sort," said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
Jack's excitement and delight were great when
Tom told him that Jessie was going to get better.
</p>

<p>
"Soon, will it be soon?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"No, it will be a long time before she's quite well,
but she has taken the right turn."
</p>

<p>
"Is the pain gone?" asked Jack in a half whisper,
remembering the white face and the little moan.
</p>

<p>
"It's better but not conquered yet, but it will
get better every day.  Would you like to come with
me the next time I go, and take her a bunch of
flowers?"
</p>

<p>
Jack's head went down.  "Not if she shuts her
eyes and makes a noise," he said.
</p>

<p>
"But her eyes are very big and wide open, and
she'll smile at you and be so pleased to see you.  I
want you and Eva to go sometimes to see her.  It's
rather dull for her lying there all day long, although
soon she will be wheeled out into the verandah."
</p>

<p>
Thus reassured Jack accepted Tom's suggestion.
Yet he experienced an inward tremor as he found
himself at the house-door which Tom opened and
entered without knocking, but he knocked at the
half-open door of the room just inside, and a girl's
voice bade him enter.
</p>

<p>
"I've brought you a visitor, Jessie, a little boy who
has been very anxious you should get well."
</p>

<p>
Jack laid his flowers on the bed.  There was no
room for fear or distress in looking at the girl who
lay there with her pretty oval face framed in two
big braids of dark hair, and with great, big grey
eyes that smiled a welcome.
</p>

<p>
"Are they for me?" she said, nodding at the
flowers.  "I'd like 'em near, so as I could smell
them," so Jack shifted his nosegay nearer the pillow.
</p>

<p>
"You must know his name, for he's coming again,
and going to bring a little chum of his with him, my
niece, Eva Kenyon.  This is Jack Stephens, and
his titles are numerous.  He's Jack the Englishman,
and Jack the Bell-ringer&mdash;he rings the bell in
church, don't you, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Not last Sunday, because we didn't want to
make a noise as you were ill," said Jack gravely.
</p>

<p>
"I'll hear it next Sunday, maybe," said Jessie.
"I wish I could come.  It's months and months
since we've been to church.  We live too far away
from one, and I've been ill a long time, too."
</p>

<p>
"When you're well enough to be wheeled out into
the verandah, you'll hear the hymns on Sunday
night.  We always prop the door open."
</p>

<p>
"That'll seem like old times," said Jessie, with
quaint old-fashionedness.  "I lived in the township
with Grannie until I was ten years old, went to
the State school every day and to Sunday school
over there"&mdash;with a nod at the church.  "Then
Grannie died, and I went home to father and mother,
but I don't like it.  It's so lonesome in the bush.
It's lovely to lie here and see the coach go by twice
a day and the horses and bullock drays and things."
</p>

<p>
But Tom, watching the delicate face flush, thought
Jessie had talked enough, and kneeling down, said a
prayer or two, and standing, sang a hymn, and then
bade the girl good-bye.
</p>

<p>
"Will you come again, and bring the little girl
you spoke of?" asked Jessie, as Jack laid a shy
hand in hers.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Jack gravely.
</p>

<p>
Once outside, he was full of talk about his visit.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go every day; she liked it, didn't she?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but you must not go too often yet, until
she's stronger.  She still has a good deal of pain to
bear, though we hope it will grow less every day."
</p>

<p>
"I thought Dr. Wilson had conquered it."
</p>

<p>
"He's made it better, but only time can make
her well."
</p>

<p>
"But she's smiling all the time."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she's extraordinarily brave, as many girls
are."
</p>

<p>
"Not so brave as boys," said Jack quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Often a great deal braver in bearing pain."
</p>

<p>
"I could take her some toys, p'raps," said Jack,
not caring for the turn the conversation had taken.
</p>

<p>
"Books are more in her line; she's a great reader."
</p>

<p>
"I s'pose you'd have to read if you could not run
about," Jack said.
</p>

<p>
"But Jessie loves reading as much as playing
games, almost better,"&mdash;a statement so wonderful
that it reduced Jack to silence.
</p>

<p>
"It was odd of you to take Jack to see that poor
sick child," said Tom's sister that evening.  "He's
been telling Eva about it, and she's wild to go with
him, but I don't think I shall let her."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I think children should be kept away from
the sight of painful things as long as possible."
</p>

<p>
"But there is nothing painful to see in visiting
Jessie.  She's a singularly pretty child, lying in bed
and nearly always smiling.  Don't you think the
sooner children learn to think about other people
the better?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know; let them be happy as long
as they can, poor mites.  I don't believe in leagues
for making children kind.  It only turns them into
self-conscious prigs."
</p>

<p>
"I quite agree, but to teach children to minister
to others without being conscious of such ministry,
is surely only teaching them the lesson of
unselfishness.  They should give out sympathy as a rose
gives out scent.  Besides, I really think the child
will be lonely when I'm away.  I've been staying
about here purposely, as long as she was in danger,
but next week I must be off again about my business.
Mrs. Mason gives her all the necessary looking after
she requires, but has no time for sitting with her or
diverting her thoughts, and it struck me that the
children looking in from time to time would be very
delightful for her and for them."
</p>

<p>
"Oh well, Eva shall go with Jack sometimes, and
the fowls are laying pretty steadily now, so I shall
be able to send a few eggs occasionally."
</p>

<p>
"I knew you would do what I asked; you always
do," Tom said, smiling at his sister.
</p>

<p>
"But it's too delightful to have you here to ask
things."  said Clarissa, bending down to kiss him.
</p>

<p>
The pleasure the children's visits gave at the
cottage was mutual.  On their side it was delightful
to plan little gifts by way of a surprise to Jessie, in
which they were aided and abetted by their home
people, but Jessie on her side proved a capital
companion, who could teach them quiet games, such as
"Beggar my neighbour," etc., or she would tell them
wonderful tales of the bush, of fires, or people who
were lost, tales that were true, that she had picked
up from one or another.
</p>

<p>
But, greatly as Jessie looked forward to her little
visitors, the happiest hours of her week were still on
Saturday and Sunday, when her clergyman friend
came to see her, for he was making the most of the
time of Jessie's enforced inactivity to talk to her
and teach her about sacred things, and he found in
her one of the brightest and most intelligent pupils
he had ever had.  She was fairly familiar with the
Bible stories, but as must necessarily be the case in
wide districts where one clergyman has to do the
work of four, her definite Church teaching was of
the slightest.
</p>

<p>
And yet, that she had very strong groping in that
direction was discovered to Tom one Sunday when,
after some simple, direct teaching about her baptism,
she looked up into his face with a sudden smile,
and said:
</p>

<p>
"Why can't I be confirmed?  I was all ready once,
about six months ago.  There was a confirmation
at Wylmington, and then I could not go, and I cried
myself sick with disappointment.  I was ill, you
see.  My back had begun to be troublesome.  Can't
you confirm me?"
</p>

<p>
Tom did not smile at the vague conception of
what confirmation meant, but answered the
hungry longing for more grace that the question
implied.
</p>

<p>
"You've asked me something I'm unable to give
you, Jessie," he said gently.  "The rite of Confirmation
is not mine to perform.  It's the Bishop, the
chief shepherd of the flock, to whom belongs that
Laying on of Hands, which brings with it, we believe,
very special gifts of the Holy Spirit."
</p>

<p>
Jessie hung her head and blushed a little.
</p>

<p>
"I knew it was the Bishop who came to Wylmington,
but I did not know just what you were.  You
seem quite different from most clergymen.  I
thought, maybe, you could confirm people."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm just an ordinary every-day Parson, but
as you seem keen about it, we will have some talks,
and see how much you understand of its meaning.
Who prepared you before?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr. Marston, the clergyman who has gone
away ill, would stop after service on the Sundays;
he came up to Wylmington, and told us boys and
girls who wished to be confirmed to stay behind
whilst he talked to us about it.  And he asked us to
get our Catechism perfect in between, and he said,
if we kept regular to the Sunday class, he would try
to see each one of us separately before the Bishop
came, but I could only go to one or two of the classes,
what with bad weather and being ill, but if I'd been
well enough to get there on the day, I believe he'd
have let me come, because I wanted it so much."
</p>

<p>
"Be confirmed, you mean," said Tom.  "Why
were you so eager?"
</p>

<p>
"Because, because," stammered Jessie with
shining eyes, "it will help to make one good.  You
promise to be good, and God helps you."
</p>

<p>
It was not a very lucid way of explaining it, but
the spirit was willing if the learning was weak, and
Tom left her with a determination that, if possible,
the girl should have her heart's desire.

CHAPTER VII
<br /><br />
A BISHOP'S VISIT
</h3>

<p>
"Everything comes to an issue to him who knows
how to wait," said Tom Chance, folding up the
local newspaper with an air of deep satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
He was sitting in the verandah at the farm, and
Betty busied herself with a pile of mending that lay
on the table before her.  Tom often found his way
up to the farm on a Saturday evening when his work
was finished, for devoted as he and his sister were to
each other, in Betty he found a more understanding
sympathiser with his work.  She looked up now
with a quick smile.
</p>

<p>
"What have you been waiting for?"
</p>

<p>
"Waiting to catch the Bishop, and I believe the
time has come when I may hope to hook him.
Anyway, I will write to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Then he's likely to be in the neighbourhood?"
</p>

<p>
"He's advertised in that paper as due at Rumney
in a fortnight's time to open their new little church."
</p>

<p>
"Not really!" cried Betty, laying down her
work.  "How perfectly delightful!  Do you know
that church has taken twenty years in the building? at
least the first money for it was collected twenty
years ago, but it was not nearly enough to cover the
cost, so it was laid aside to wait for better days, and
it seemed as if the better days were never coming.
Now one energetic farmer has taken it up, and pushed
it through by hook or crook, but I did not know it
was so near completion.  I must get over to the
opening."
</p>

<p>
"It is to be a very gala day by the newspaper
account, and I think you might take me with you,
and we'll get hold of the Bishop and bring him
back with us.  Can you manage it, do you
think?"
</p>

<p>
"What makes you want him so much?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you if you care to hear."
</p>

<p>
Betty nodded, and there, in the glory of the setting
sun which was flooding the western sky with every
hue of the rainbow, she sat and listened to Jessie's
story, her eyes filling with tears.
</p>

<p>
"But how lovely," she said, when he finished.
"So you've planned that the Bishop shall come
here on purpose to confirm her?"
</p>

<p>
"If he will and can; I've never had a keener
candidate.  Since that first talk with her I've been
giving her a regular course of preparation for
confirmation, not holding out any hope that it might
be here and now, in case no opportunity presented
itself, but just to have her ready in case one might
be given me."
</p>

<p>
"Shall you tell her about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Not till I get the Bishop's answer.  The
disappointment would be too bitter if it came a second
time."
</p>

<p>
But the Bishop's answer was kind and favourable.
He had just four hours to spare, and provided he
could be fetched and taken back to the nearest
railway station when the service was over, he would be
delighted to come.
</p>

<p>
The children happened to call immediately after
Tom had brought Jessie the wonderful news, and
found her simply radiant with joy.
</p>

<p>
"The Bishop's coming on purpose to confirm
me.  Isn't it good of him and of Mr. Chance to have
settled it?  I'm so happy, I don't know how to lie
still.  I'd like to be up and jumping for joy."
</p>

<p>
But Jack stood looking at her with wondering eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand," he said.  "What makes
you so happy?"
</p>

<p>
"That I'm going to be confirmed," said Jessie
simply.  "I've wished it ever so much, and thought
I might wait for years."
</p>

<p>
"What's being confirmed?"
</p>

<p>
Jessie flushed a little.  "Being strengthened by
God's Holy Spirit.  It's only the Bishop who can
confirm you, you know."
</p>

<p>
Jack asked no more; here was something quite
beyond his understanding.  Perhaps Uncle Tom
could make it clearer if he could talk to him about
it when they were quite alone.
</p>

<p>
He approached the subject cautiously on the
following morning as he trotted down to church by
Tom's side.
</p>

<p>
"Is a Bishop a sort of head doctor?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Tom gave an inward chuckle, but kept outwardly
grave.
</p>

<p>
"That's not exactly how I should describe him;
he is the head of the clergy in any diocese where he
may be placed, a diocese means a certain division of
the church which is given into his keeping, and the
clergy have to look up to him as their head.  What
made you think he was a head doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"I didn't understand, but Jessie said he would
lay his hands upon her and make her strong."
</p>

<p>
They had reached the church door, and Tom
unlocked it and passed in before he answered.  Then,
in the simplest language he could command, he drew
Jack to his side and gave him his first lesson on
the sacraments, the outward signs which&mdash;God
appointed&mdash;convey the inward grace.  He talked
to him of baptism, pointing to the tiny font,
as he spoke, where the water poured on the baby's
face, accompanied with the clergyman's prayer,
was the sign of the Holy Spirit descending upon the
little child; how, after confirmation, that child would
be dedicated to God to be His faithful soldier and
servant until his life's end.
</p>

<p>
"And when you are a big boy, Jack, you will, I
hope, do what Jessie is so anxious to do now, you
will stand before the Bishop&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Will Jessie stand.  Will she be strong enough?"
broke in Jack.
</p>

<p>
"No, God will know she can't stand, but she will
lie with folded hands and make her promise to go
on serving God all her life and to fight against the
devil and all his works, and then the Bishop will lay
his hands upon her head and pray that the Holy
Spirit may come upon her and make her strong
enough by His gifts to keep this promise.  It is that
strength, we believe the laying on of hands conveys."
</p>

<p>
"Then it won't make Jessie walk?" said Jack
dejectedly.
</p>

<p>
"Dear boy, it will make her walk straight on the
road towards God, and that is the first thing, the
most important thing in all the world, to get nearer
to God.  But if ever she is able to walk again it will
be God that gives her the power.  And now it is
time you began to ring the bell."
</p>

<p>
But Jack had some more questions to ask.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I see Jessie confirmed, see the Bishop lay
his hands on her head?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, surely, if you wish it, and join your prayer
with his.  'Pray God give Jessie Thy Holy Spirit.'"
</p>

<p>
"And when will I be big enough?"
</p>

<p>
"To be confirmed, do you mean?  It's not so
much a question of years, or size, as of understanding,
Jack; understanding what you are doing.  Jessie
quite understands."
</p>

<p>
"You said when I was big.  I want to be big
most of all to go to father.  He will fetch me when
I'm big enough."
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps it might be before father fetches
you, in this very church.  Who knows?  But no
one can settle that now."
</p>

<p>
Jack did not speak of his talk with Uncle Tom
even to Aunt Betty, but it sank deep in his heart,
taking its place side by side with the great event
that he looked forward to in future years, when
"he was big," when father would come to fetch him;
and before that, Uncle Tom had suggested that he
might be confirmed as Jessie was going to be
confirmed.  He could not have put the notion into
words yet, but the seed which was planted in his
heart that Sunday sprouted lustily.  Meanwhile, the
day of the opening of Rumney Church and of Jessie's
confirmation drew near.  Happily the day proved
fine, one of those wonderfully brilliant Tasmanian
days that almost beggars description.  Tom presented
himself in good time at the farm, and failing to find
anyone in the house, passed round to the stables at
the back, where he found Betty putting Tim, the
handsome mettlesome pony, into the shafts of the cart.
</p>

<p>
"But let me," said Tom, springing to her assistance.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, no," said Betty with a laugh.  "Tim
resents strangers and gets possessed of an evil spirit
if anyone handles him but a known and trusted
friend.  I always have to harness him when I go
anywhere.  Gently, Tim, gently," as Tim's head
went up with a snort as Tom drew near.  "I hope
you don't mind trusting yourself to me.  There's
no room for father if we bring the Bishop back.  It's
a lovely drive, but very rough for the last two miles
through a bush road.  To go round makes five miles
difference."
</p>

<p>
"If I minded unmade roads or untrained horses
I should hardly be fitted for my work as a Bush
parson," said Tom with a gay laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, get in then, and we'll be off."
</p>

<p>
The descent through the paddock was made
chiefly on the pony's back legs, but once on the open
road he settled to his paces and conversation was
possible.  The going was rapid, for uphill or down&mdash;and
in that part of the world it is always one or the
other&mdash;seemed to make no difference to Tim.
</p>

<p>
"'My steed on his journey was gay, As I on my
journey to Heaven'" quoted Tom, "a little
break-neck, perhaps, for the bush road you promise me
for the last part of the way."
</p>

<p>
"Which shows how little you know of Tim; you
will see how soberly and sure-footedly he will pick
his way.  I believe you are nervous, notwithstanding
your boast when you started!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will promise not to have hysterics or
clutch at the reins," said Tom, jumping down to
open the gate which barred the bush road from the
highway.  And here it meant careful going, for
bullock drays had been lately along carting away
some freshly hewn timber, and in many places the
cart sank into the ruts almost up to the axles.  Tom
got out and walked to lighten the weight on the
pony's back.  It was really pretty to see the dainty
way the creature put down its feet, avoiding bigger
stones and curvetting past the huge logs that
often-times blocked the road, making a diversion into the
fern-clothed sides necessary.
</p>

<p>
"But it's hardly a safe way for even as good a
driver as Betty," he thought, and almost before the
thought framed itself, Tim was rearing and backing,
and then, with a swift swerve, would have smashed
himself, Betty, and the cart, against the enormous
bole of a tree, but for Tom's hasty dash to his head.
For a moment the issue seemed doubtful, but Tom's
strong hand and soothing voice brought him into
subjection, and he stood trembling from head to foot.
</p>

<p>
"And what was all the fuss about?" said Tom,
patting Tim's head with as much confidence as if
they were friends of long standing.  "Let's have a
look, old man, and see if we can't get over the
difficulty," and round the curve which Tim had just
come, Tom saw the half length of a tree which had
been lately felled from which a long piece of bark
had been stripped and the dazzling flicker of
sunshine across it had startled Tim and terrified him.
</p>

<p>
But realizing now what it was, the difficulty was
at an end, and Tim passed by without further
resistance.
</p>

<p>
"It's smoother now; you can get in if you like,"
said Betty, a little crossly, and Tom mounted to her
side.
</p>

<p>
"It's a nasty fall to my pride," she said after a
moment.  "We should have been smashed up into
matchwood but for you, and hitherto I'm the only
one in the family with whom Tim has never
misbehaved himself."
</p>

<p>
"But it puts me on equal terms with you again,
and soothes my wounded vanity.  You can't
forget that on the first occasion we met you caught
me out at cricket," Tom answered, good-humouredly.
</p>

<p>
"But I am doubly in the wrong, for I told you
Tim would not let you touch him, and he was as a
lamb in your hands," went on Betty, still put
out.
</p>

<p>
"But that is something I was born with: that is
no credit to me.  I love all animals, and I think they
know it."
</p>

<p>
They were through the bush now and trotting
gaily along the road to Rumney, passing groups of
people from the various farms, all bent in the same
direction.
</p>

<p>
"Everyone comes," said Betty, "on an occasion
of this kind.  Roman Catholics and every
denomination that calls itself Christian."
</p>

<p>
"That seems to me rather beautiful.  Ah! there
is the Bishop waiting by the foot of the hill with
quite a cluster of people about him."
</p>

<p>
"I'll let you down with your bag and drive on to
the inn, and put up Tim," said Betty, and Tom
tactfully made no offer to do it for her.
</p>

<p>
Very soon she was wending her way, with many
others, to the new little church built on the side of
a hill just beyond the township in a clearing in the
bush.  There was no fence round it, no properly-made
path to lead up to it, but there was a nameless
charm in the primitive simplicity of it all, and Betty
went in and thanked God that at last the church, so
long in hand, was completed.
</p>

<p>
There was a pretty little altar with a wooden
cross and vases of fresh flowers on either side of it, a
prayer desk, which at present had to serve as lectern
desk, and pulpit, and a very simple font, but benches
had had to be borrowed from the school-house hard
by.  It was hoped that the offerings of the day
might help to provide some new ones.  But Betty's
attention was arrested by the sound of singing, and
glancing through the open door of the porch, she
saw a little procession of clergy winding its way up
the hill towards the church, the Bishop bringing up
the rear.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The Church's one foundation<br />
  Is Jesus Christ her Lord&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
so the words rang&mdash;at first only sung by the clergy,
but as they neared the door the congregation rose as
one man to their feet, and the well-known hymn was
taken up lustily until the little building was filled
with the volume of sound.
</p>

<p>
To Betty, all unused to church functions, it seemed
the most beautiful service she had ever attended,
the touching words of consecration, the collects that
followed when the Bishop, kneeling in the middle of
the step that led up into the tiny sanctuary, prayed
God to let His blessing rest upon this house and upon
the people that should worship therein, and last of
all the Bishop's address, quite short and simple, so
that everyone present could fully understand, and
yet so forcible in its simplicity, so impressive on the
importance of this dedication day, which he begged
them to observe as a <i>holiday</i> from that time forward,
a day of joyous thanksgiving that God had allowed
them, as to Solomon, to build Him a house.
And then the Bishop raised his hands in supplication.
</p>

<p>
"Prosper Thou the work of their hands upon
them, O Lord; O prosper Thou their handiwork."
</p>

<p>
The Blessing and a recessional hymn closed the
short and simple service, and then, whilst the
congregation trooped off to the paddocks where sports
were to finish the day's holiday, the Bishop, after a
hasty lunch provided at the farmer's house near by,
announced himself ready to accompany Betty and
Tom Chance.
</p>

<p>
An hour later the cart drew up at the door of the
cottage opposite the church, and the Bishop stood
for a moment bareheaded on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Peace be to this house," he said in his kindly
tones, then stooped to pat the head of the little boy
in a white suit who stood with his cap in his hand
earnestly looking up into his face.
</p>

<p>
"Jessie's little brother?" he suggested.
</p>

<p>
"No, my little nephew," smiled Betty, "but he
was very anxious to see Jessie confirmed."
</p>

<p>
"And it's always well to have a congregation,"
answered the Bishop, and then he passed into the
room where Jessie lay, a pretty picture in her soft
tulle cap and white muslin jacket which Betty had
provided for her confirmation day.  A flush was on
her cheeks, and her eyes glowed like stars as the
Bishop bent over her and took her hand, speaking
a few kind encouraging words.  And then his eye
glanced round the crowded room, for Jessie's parents
had driven over for the day, and a neighbour or two
had expressed the wish to be present.
</p>

<p>
"It seems rather close and crowded, doesn't it?"
said the Bishop, turning to Tom who stood by the
open doorway, "and there is plenty of room over
there," with a nod at the little church opposite.
"I think we could carry her, bed and all, over there,
don't you?  Will you see to it, whilst I adjourn to
the vestry and put on my robes?"
</p>

<p>
"But of course I could nearly carry her alone,"
said Tom, so between him and her father, Jessie
was gently moved over the road through the porch,
and into the church beyond, whilst Jack to make the
thing complete, climbed on to his usual hassock and
rang the bell until the Bishop, preceded by Uncle
Tom, issued from the vestry, and then he slipped
quietly into a seat where he could watch the whole
service from beginning to end.  It was just as
Uncle Tom had pictured it; Jessie lay there with
folded hands and a radiant face making her promise
with a clear confident voice, and then the Bishop
drew near and laid his hands upon her head, and
Jack watched with awe-struck eyes, and wondered
if the wind that came rushing down from the hills at
that moment and went whistling by the church was
the outward sign of the Holy Spirit descending upon
Jessie and making her strong.  She was not strong
at present for she was crying!
</p>

<p>
And then the Bishop still stood by her looking
down on her with a tender smile, and talked of how
once our Lord had called a child to Him, and how
he was sure His call had come to her to-day, a call
to which she was very ready to listen, and he
believed she would follow Him to her life's end.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'll try," said Jessie, smiling through her
tears.
</p>

<p>
There was quite a long pause at the end of the
service, when the tiny congregation remained
kneeling, praying for the child who had so earnestly
renewed her baptismal promises.
</p>

<p>
"Don't carry me back home yet.  I want to see
the Bishop, and to thank him for coming," whispered
Jessie, and the Bishop, bag in hand, came down the
church and took her hand in his.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Bishop, if I live to be quite an old woman,
I won't forget your coming here to-day," she said.
</p>

<p>
"It's been a happy day for us both, Jessie," was
the kind answer.  "God have you in His keeping
now and evermore," and with that final blessing the
Bishop hurried off to his train.  After putting him
into the cart, Tom and her father returned to carry
Jessie back.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm ready to go now," she said.  "I'm
very tired, but it has been the happiest day of my
life, the grandest, happiest day!"
</p>

<p>
"And when I'm big I'll be confirmed like Jessie,"
thought Jack, as he sped home, "but I hope I'll
stand on my feet, not lie on a bed as she did."
</p>

<p>
"It was the loveliest confirmation I have ever
been at," said Tom to his sister that night.  "I
wish you had come to it, Clarissa."
</p>

<p>
"I was too shy," his sister answered.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br /><br />
TWO LEAVE-TAKINGS
</h3>

<p>
It seemed quite natural to Jack that Jessie's strength
improved marvellously from the day of her
confirmation, for although Tom had tried to teach
him something of the outward sign which denotes
the spiritual grace, his childish mind recurred to
his first idea, and he did not for a moment question
that Jessie's quickened recovery was chiefly due to
the Bishop's laying on of hands.
</p>

<p>
"You said the Bishop's hands would make her
strong, didn't you?" he remarked one day to Tom,
and Tom smiled down on him.
</p>

<p>
"I was talking of her soul rather than her body,
Jack, but it seems as if God in His goodness were
sending her both together."
</p>

<p>
So it was that from sitting up in a chair for a
considerable portion of the day, Jessie soon began
to walk a little, first to the garden gate, then a few
steps along the road, and one summer evening in
the autumn, to Jack's great excitement and delight,
he saw her seated in a chair at the bottom of the
church when he went down as usual to ring the bell.
What did not please him so well was that his
wandering thoughts in the service were brought back
to everyday life by the mention of her name in
church, in what connection he was too greatly
astonished to discover.  He was only certain that
he had heard her name, and what could be the good
of saying prayers for her when she was sitting
behind all the time and looking nearly well?  His
puzzledom, it almost might be called annoyance,
at the unreasonableness of the thing kept his mind
straying for the remainder of the service, and he
was glad that under cover of waiting behind to
carry something back for Uncle Tom after church,
he had a chance of putting the matter before him.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom, we didn't want to pray for Jessie
Butler, to-night.  What did you do it for?  Did
not you see, she was in church and quite better?"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Which shows you weren't listening very much,
Jack, or you would have found out we weren't
praying for her in the way of asking God to give
her anything.  We were thanking Him for making
her better, and, of course, it was much better to
wait until she could be there to give thanks for
herself.  It would have very little meaning else.  Now,
I will tell you a story," and very picturesquely
Tom related the story of the ten lepers.
</p>

<p>
"Only one out of the whole lot, Jack, who
remembered to give thanks to God.  A lot of us
are like that!  We say 'Give us this day our daily
bread,' and at the end of the day we forget to thank
God for the food we never lack."
</p>

<p>
Jack said little, but the lesson went home.
</p>

<p>
Jessie's lessons with her clergyman still continued
for many weeks after her confirmation, for Tom
was preparing her for her first Communion, and the
next time he was able to hold a celebration at the
little church, Jessie was one of the communicants.
Jack's interest over that was far less keen than about
her confirmation.  It was "something grown-up
people stayed for, and children could not," was all
that he grasped at present, and Tom left it at that,
willing that the teaching about the greatest
Sacrament should be given a little later.  Very quickly
after Jessie's first Communion there came the
letter suggesting that it was time for her to go home.
She was quite independent now of the doctor's
attendance.  She showed the letter to Tom when
he came to see her, making no comment.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be glad to go back and see them all
again, I expect," but Jessie lifted her great eyes
to him quite full of tears.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;" she said.  "Of course, I want to
see them, but although I've been ill down here, and
had a lot of pain, I've had the happiest time of
my life.  You've taught me a lot, and I've been
confirmed and been to Communion, and when I
go back I'll see no one p'raps for weeks and weeks.
It seems so easy to be good when you are here, but
when no one talks to you, and Sunday after Sunday
you never get nigh a church, and you work and
work and always feel tired it doesn't come so easy."
</p>

<p>
"But you won't work for a bit yet, Jessie; you're
not fit for it."
</p>

<p>
"It's easier to work than to sit still all day and
do nothing, and see mother bustling round with
never a minute to herself.  Here there is no work I
ought to be doing, you see."
</p>

<p>
Tom sat pondering.  "Well, for the present you
must try and make yourself content.  I quite see
that your father and mother, hard-working people,
can't afford to keep you here any longer than is
necessary&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I was selfish.  I'd forgotten that," said
Jessie.
</p>

<p>
"And I want you to think of this, Jessie; that
God who has given you so much help lately will
still be near you, and able to keep you in the straight
path when He takes some of those helps away.  I
know it's much more difficult for you, but it may
help to strengthen your spiritual life, to teach
you to stand alone.  You'll say your prayers and
keep your Bible reading regular."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Jessie said, "but it's not easy when
there's no one who can tell you what it means when
you get puzzled."
</p>

<p>
"I can't quite tell where I shall go when my
time here comes to an end, but I will try and see
you sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you, ever so much!  That will make
everything different; for when I sit sewing in the
verandah&mdash;I'll do all the sewing&mdash;I shall feel that
one time I shall look up and see you come riding
through the bush, and p'raps&mdash;p'raps, if you've
nowhere else to go, you'll stop the night.  Mother
would be pleased."
</p>

<p>
"There are many more improbable things than
that," Tom said.
</p>

<p>
The children were loud in their lamentations over
Jessie's leaving.
</p>

<p>
"Why can't you stop forever and ever?" Eva
demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Because I've got a mother and father who
want me back again."
</p>

<p>
"It's miles and miles away; we can't come and
see you, can we?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know.  We're three miles back from
Wylmington Falls, where people come picnicing
in summer time.  If you came out there one day
you might get on to us."
</p>

<p>
It did not sound very probable.
</p>

<p>
"When are you going?" he asked rather drearily.
</p>

<p>
"The day after to-morrow; they're sending the
buggy to fetch me."
</p>

<p>
"We'll come to the corner at the bottom of the
lane to see you and wave to you, won't we, Eva?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, wave to you," echoed Eva, beginning to
smile again, the prospect of active service consoling
her for Jessie's departure.
</p>

<p>
So on the following Saturday two eager children,
with flowers in one hand and handkerchiefs in the
other, stood waiting at their corner.  This time the
waiting was a short one, for a buggy came slowly up
the hill, and in front, supported by cushions, sat
Jessie by her father's side, whilst her small belongings
were packed in behind; and at sight of the waiting
pair, Mr. Butler drew rein and Eva climbed up
with Jack's assistance to give Jessie a parting kiss,
and Jack lifted his cap and presented his flowers,
holding himself very straight lest Jessie should offer
to kiss him too; but she knew better, only shook him
heartily by the hand, and thanked him for all his
kindness and then the buggy moved on, followed by
the shouts of the children.
</p>

<p>
"But I wish she hadn't gone," said Jack as the
carriage and its occupants were lost to sight.  "We'll
miss her every day."
</p>

<p>
Tom came up to the farm that evening for he had
something to discuss, and wanted Betty's counsel.
</p>

<p>
"You know what girls can do more than I," he
said when he had settled down to his pipe in the
verandah.  "I've Jessie Butler on my mind.  My
time here now is short&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I didn't know you were leaving at any
definite time," said Betty quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Nor did I until to-day, but I've a letter from
the Bishop to say that your late vicar has resigned,
and that he is going to put in a younger man who
can compass the work better."
</p>

<p>
"Why not you?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I refused to take it," said Tom simply.
"It's not what I came out for, although I've had a
very happy time here."
</p>

<p>
"And the new man is coming soon?"
</p>

<p>
"As soon as the Bishop can find him.  He has
one or two that he would like to send here, but I'm
wandering from my point.  Before I leave, I should
like to find something for Jessie to do.  She's utterly
unfitted for life on a back block.  It's too rough for
her, and the work too heavy.  She can't do anything
yet, but before the winter sets in I'd like to see her
settled at work she can do, something fairly quiet
and regular.  What do delicate girls do?  What
are they fit for," and Tom glanced appealingly at
Betty.
</p>

<p>
"Sewing would be too sedentary, and she would
not get it either, living where she does," said Betty.
</p>

<p>
"That's just it; I want to move her from where
she is, but she's not strong enough for service."
</p>

<p>
"She might help in an infant school where such
help is needed.  She has read a good deal and passed
all her standards, and has picked up a good deal of
desultory knowledge which, from what the children
tell me of the way she talks to them, I should think
she had a gift for imparting."
</p>

<p>
"The very thing," cried Tom, "and I believe
there is an opening at Wylmington, which has the
advantage of not being far from home in case of a
breakdown.  I was in the little school there the
other day, and the teacher, Miss Armstrong, was
saying that it was imperative that she must have
help with the tinies, and that she had written to
the department about it.  Now, if I could only put
an oar in and get the post for Jessie, she could spend
her spare time in study, and in qualifying herself
to pass the examinations necessary for her to become
a certificated teacher.  In years to come she might
get quite strong enough to undertake the care of
some country school."
</p>

<p>
Tom lost no time in getting into touch with the
authorities, with the result that in a few weeks' time
he had the offer of the post which he sought for Jessie.
</p>

<p>
Jessie's imaginings about the parson's first visit
to her home only came partly true, for on one
soaking wet afternoon as the light was beginning
to wane, a dripping man, clad in waterproof from
top to toe, came riding up to the door, and she could
hardly believe her eyes when the rider turned out to
be Tom.  Her greeting was absolutely incoherent
in its gladness.
</p>

<p>
"Mother, father," she cried flying to the door,
"come, come quickly.  Here's Mr. Chance, come to
see us, and he must be soaking to the skin."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it," said Tom, dismounting cheerily
from his horse and shaking the rain from the brim
of his hat, "thanks to my overalls.  I have a
proposal to make to your father and mother, the answer
to which is urgent, and I could not wait for fine
weather."
</p>

<p>
"Well, everything must wait until you are fed,
and warmed, and dried," said hospitable Mrs. Butler,
hastening forward, "Fred," to a tall boy behind&mdash;"Come,
take the horse, will you?  Come in, come in,
Mr. Chance; it was good of you to ride through the
bush on a day like this, for when it rains it means
business in our country."
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later Tom sat in the living-room
before a log fire cracking cheerily in the open fireplace,
which sent a leaping shower of flame and sparks
up the chimney.  The family, of varying sex and
sizes, having accorded the visitor shy greeting,
dispersed, leaving the space clear for Mrs. Butler
and Jessie, who bustled round preparing a meal
of the best viands the house could produce at so short
a notice.
</p>

<p>
After the rough but hospitable meal, Tom resumed
his seat near the fire and laid his proposal
before them, that Jessie should become temporary
assistant teacher in the little school at Wylmington,
with the view of following teaching as her profession.
Miss Armstrong had expressed her willingness to
give her a helping hand with her studies, and Jessie
could live at the school-house with her.  Indeed,
Miss Armstrong would be glad to welcome her
there, as the life was too lonely a one for any girl
to face.
</p>

<p>
Jessie listened to the plan as it unfolded itself
with occasional exclamations of delight, but her
father demurred.
</p>

<p>
"The lass isn't strong.  I'd rather have her here
under our own eyes for a bit."
</p>

<p>
"But it's the future we must look to, Harry.  It's
putting Jessie in the way of earning her own living.
If anything ails her she's not far from home," said
the more sensible mother.  "I believe we must let
her go."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Tom, as if he were accepting
a favour, rather than conferring one.  "I wanted
to feel Jessie had found her proper niche before I
said good-bye."
</p>

<p>
Jessie's heart sank like lead, all the joy at the
thought of the life of useful work which opened out
before her dashed by the near prospect of losing
the friend who had so greatly helped her, but she
said nothing.  Her regret was too deep for words.
She simply turned imploring eyes upon the speaker
as if making dumb appeal to him to reverse his
decision.
</p>

<p>
"It seems a pity you should leave us," said the
farmer with slow deliberation.  "I don't profess
to know much about parsons and their work, but
it strikes me you are the right man in the right place."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Tom, with a little laugh,
"but I never came to stop.  I came to fill a gap;
I am leaving for the mainland almost directly."
</p>

<p>
"Never coming back?" said Jessie, with a choke
in her voice.
</p>

<p>
"Never is a big word, Jessie.  I hope certainly
to revisit Tasmania before I go back to England,
but it may be a long time first.  I did not come
to the colony with a notion of finally settling here."
</p>

<p>
Then he gave them a short sketch of the work
he had been sent out to do.
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" said the farmer, "very good as far
as it goes, but it seems to me a bit like lighting a
fire and setting it in a blaze and then leaving it to
die down to a heap of ashes."
</p>

<p>
"But we hope it may lead to an extension of the
church's work."
</p>

<p>
"May be," said Butler, but his tone was incredulous.
</p>

<p>
Then Tom rose and said he must be getting on his
way.
</p>

<p>
"You'd have some difficulty in finding it on a
night like this," said the farmer with a chuckle.
"Listen to it," and across the swirl of the rain upon
the roof and windows came the roar of the wind
through the bush.  "Best stay here for the night.
We can offer you a shake down in here, can't we,
wife?  And a sound roof to cover you."
</p>

<p>
Tom rose and went to the door before making a
final decision, but the wild rush of wind and rain
in his face made him close it again pretty quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you; I'll stay, although I'm afraid I'm
causing you some inconvenience, but it would take
a more experienced bushman than I to find my
way on a night like this."
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me," said Mrs. Butler a little shyly,
"that having the parson here, we might have prayers
to-night, before we settle in.  It's not Sunday, but
it's many a Sunday we have to do without 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Call the others in, then," said Butler, not
altogether pleased by the innovation, so in trooped
the boys and girls wide-eyed and smiling at the
novelty of prayers in the middle of the week.
</p>

<p>
But they all felt there was something in it when
Tom began.  His manly earnestness was infectious
and it was quite like church prayers after all, for he
read a Psalm and then a few verses from the Bible,
following on with familiar collects.
</p>

<p>
"Lighten our darkness, O Lord, and by Thy
great mercy defend us from the perils and dangers
of the night," he said, and the thunderous crash
of a tree falling not far from the house reminded
his listeners that the perils of the night were close
about them&mdash;even at their doors.
</p>

<p>
"I should like us to sing a hymn together,"
said Tom as he rose from his knees, "something we
all know.  Shall it be 'Abide with me?'" and he
started it in a strong clear voice and very soon the
whole family joined in, not absolutely correctly
perhaps, in time or tune, but with heartiness that
made it effective.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Butler at the end.  "Some
folks say that extempore prayers come more from
the heart, but for my part I like those I've been used
to from a boy."
</p>

<p>
Then the family slipped off to bed, and the sofa
was pushed nearer the fire and a few rugs brought
in and soon Tom was settled in for the night.  With
the first streak of dawn he was awake and pushed his
way into the outer kitchen in search of soap and
water, but there he found some one had been before
him, and everything had been arranged for his
comfort; and later Jessie appeared, carrying him his
breakfast on a neat tray.
</p>

<p>
"It's kind of you to enable me to make an early
start, and the weather is kind too.  What a lovely
morning after that wild night," but Jessie's heart
was too full of other things to think of the weather.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Chance, how will I keep good when you're gone?"
</p>

<p>
"No one keeps you good," said Tom, "except
God's Holy Spirit, which is yours already and who
will abide with you for the asking.  And for the
rest, Jessie, do your work lovingly and carefully,
as in God's sight, and on Sunday you can give a
helping hand in the school and teach the little ones
about holy things.  You can help along the church's
work in the place if you have a mind to."
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Butler came in, and a quarter of an
hour later Tom was wending his way back to
Wylmington.
</p>

<p>
The following Sunday was his last in Wallaroo,
and the little church was packed to hear his last
sermon, and quite a number of people waited outside
the church to shake him by the hand and bid him
Godspeed, a send-off he much preferred to the social
evening which it had been proposed to give him
in the previous week, but which his many engagements
had forced him to decline.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom," said Jack, thrusting his hand into
Tom's as they walked home together, "you will
come back, won't you, as everyone's so sorry you're
going away?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't suppose I shall come back as your
clergyman, Jack, but I shall certainly come back
before I go to England, in fact whenever a chance
presents itself."
</p>

<p>
"But Eva and I won't watch for you on Saturday
afternoons?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm afraid you won't, but some day, when
you least expect me, I shall come popping in by
the coach, or on my feet."
</p>

<p>
"And you'll come when I'm confirmed same as
Jessie?" said Jack.
</p>

<p>
Tom smiled to himself, well pleased that Jessie's
confirmation had made so deep an impression
upon the little boy.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know even if I shall be in the colony
then, but if I'm anywhere within reach I'll come
when you are confirmed," said Tom.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Betty," said Jack, as Betty tucked him
into bed that night, "you need not cry any more,
Uncle Tom will come back some day."
</p>

<p>
"But what nonsense you are talking.  I'm not
crying," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"But you <i>did</i> cry in church, and I s'pose it's
because Uncle Tom is going away.  If not, what
<i>did</i> you cry for?" said Jack, a question Aunt
Betty did not think fit to answer.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br /><br />
A SURPRISE VISIT
</h3>

<p>
Four years had passed since Tom Chance had left
Tasmania, and it was with a pleasurable quickening
of pulse that he found himself back in the island
and walking along the hilly road from the station
towards Wallaroo.  He had told no one he was
coming, for he had planned once or twice before to
pay a flying visit which pressure of work had made
him obliged to defer, so this time he had determined
to take his friends by surprise.  His years of absence
had been full of strenuous work, and he had travelled
through many parts of the huge continent, up the
Murray River, to New South Wales and Queensland,
and wherever he had gone his strong personality
and convincing earnestness had left behind a certain
quickening of church life which in many cases
proved permanent.  And now he was conscious
of brain fag, of a need for a holiday, and had made
up his mind quite suddenly to take one, and it was
natural that he should spend it with his sister and
in revisiting some of his Tasmanian friends.  The
coach had not met the train by which he arrived,
and he had left his baggage at the station and
was walking the eight miles which separated the
railway from Wallaroo.
</p>

<p>
And he commended himself for his decision as he
strode leisurely along the zig-zag road which at every
turn disclosed a wider and more beautiful view, and
to his eyes, tired with the arid wastes through
which he had lately travelled, the blue atmosphere
and exquisite colouring of the island seemed little
short of Paradise.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, in all his travels, Tasmania was the spot
which had wound itself most closely round his heart.
And from the land his mind passed on to the faces
he was so soon to see again, Clarissa's joyous welcome,
and that of his friends at the farm.  Children's
memories were short; he could scarcely hope that
Eva would remember him, and of Jack he had heard
not long since that he had developed from the
delightful innocence and frankness of childhood,
into a somewhat bumptious schoolboy, at least
such was his sister's report.
</p>

<p>
"And Betty seems rather harassed with the care
of him," she had said in her last letter.  "She said
the other day that she so wished he could have
remained under your influence as he needs a man's
hand, and his father is anxious that the boy should
remain under her care until he is fourteen years
old, when a sister of his will be returning for good
from India and promises him a home."
</p>

<p>
It was this report that had made Tom decide to
sail for Tasmania at once.  If he could be of service
to Betty in the absence of little Jack's father, he
might turn his holiday to good account.  Jack had
been sent to the State school some six months ago,
and the society of boys older than himself had
probably gone to his head like wine, and made him
lose his balance, in which case a little judicious
snubbing might have good effect.
</p>

<p>
So thought Tom Chance as he breasted the last
steep incline from the top of which he would catch
his first glimpse of the township.  Another mile
and he would be at home, and very much at home
he felt, as he walked through the straggling street,
exchanging greetings with one and another who
remembered him.  Then came the turn into the
familiar green lane, where so often two little friends
had waited for him on a Saturday afternoon; but
to-day no one was in sight, but just as he reached
the gate of his sister's house a child with a bright
face and a long plait of dark hair down her back,
came running down the path whom Tom found it
difficult to recognise as the curly-headed dumpling
of five that he had left behind him.  But no such
great difference had the four years worked upon
Tom himself, and Eva stood still for a moment,
regarding him with startled wonder in her eyes;
then as full recognition dawned upon her she came
flying towards him with open arms.
</p>

<p>
"Mother, mother," she called back over her
shoulder.  "Here's Uncle Tom come to see us,"
and the next instant Eva's arms were round her
uncle's neck.
</p>

<p>
And Clarissa, a younger, rosier, happier Clarissa,
came hurrying up behind.
</p>

<p>
"But Tom, how naughty of you not to let us
know you were coming," she said when the first
greetings were over, "not to have given me the
joy of anticipation and of preparation.  Now you
will have to take just what you can get.  I've
improved your prophet's chamber though, since you
lived in it.  I've added a little writing-table and
an easy chair.  Life has taken a different colour
altogether since last you came."
</p>

<p>
And so she chatted on as she hurried on her
preparations for tea, giving her brother no time
for explanations.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you've come to stop a long, long time,"
she said at last.
</p>

<p>
"I've come to spend my holiday with you.
I've not had one since I came to the colony, and
suddenly felt in need of it."
</p>

<p>
"And that's six weeks and sometimes seven in
the summer time," said Eva clapping her hands.
</p>

<p>
"I was quite flattered that you remembered me,
Eva; you were such a tiny mite when I left, a
round dumpling of a niece, and now you have grown
into a little girl, with a pig-tail down your back."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't forget," said Eva, "when mother
talks of you every day and your likeness looks at
me as I go to sleep.  Why I say good-night to you,
same as if you were there."
</p>

<p>
"I think I'll go over and see them at the farm,"
said Tom, when tea was ended.  "I want to surprise
them as I surprised you, and you can come with me,
Eva, and see your chum."
</p>

<p>
Eva's head went down, and Tom fancied he
saw tears on her long lashes.  "I'll stay with
mother, thank you.  Jack isn't chummy any
more.  He doesn't want me now he has boys to
play with."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I expect he does," said Tom, consolingly,
"but now he goes to school and has regular lessons
he can't have so much time for play, nor should
you have, by rights.  I suppose Eva has lessons
to learn as well as Jack?" turning to Clarissa.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't let her go to the State school;
there is a girls' school opened in the place by a rather
nice Englishwoman, and Eva goes to her every
morning and works at home in the afternoon,
but it's out of school hours that she misses Jack.
I don't know what has come over the boy.  He
says he has 'no use' for girls."
</p>

<p>
Tom laughed a little, but thought that Master
Jack wanted bringing down a peg or two.
However, he would go and see for himself.
</p>

<p>
It was getting dusk as he crossed the paddock,
and no one seemed moving about the farm premises.
He had half hoped that Jack might have been
playing about somewhere, and that his first meeting
with the boy might have been when he was alone.
He let himself in gently by the garden gate and
stood looking round him.  Every window and door
stood open, and in the verandah, lying back in a
long wicker chair, was Betty.  The attitude was
such an unusual one that Tom divined at once that
all was not well with her.  There was weariness
written on every line of the recumbent figure, not
weariness of body only, but weariness of mind.
And then Tom felt he had no right to watch her
and went forward to speak to her.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a late visitor, Miss Treherne, but may I
come in?"
</p>

<p>
Betty sprang to her feet with a glad cry of welcome.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it odd? you were the very man I was
wishing for.  I wanted to talk to you about so
many things, and now you are here.  Father and
mother have gone over to Wylmington to keep
the Carltons' silver wedding day, and I don't expect
them back until quite late."
</p>

<p>
"So that some of the things you want to say to
me can be said here and now," said Tom, sinking
down into a chair by her side.  "But first, I must
see my friend Jack.  Shall I find the rogue round by
the stables?"
</p>

<p>
"He's in bed," said Betty, shortly.
</p>

<p>
"So you keep him to early hours," said Tom.
"I left Eva talking to her mother."
</p>

<p>
"He's in bed because he's naughty, and it's the
only punishment I can inflict, and I should not be
surprised any day if he refused to go, and what my
next move would be does not yet appear.  It's
quite certain I can't beat him."
</p>

<p>
"But your father could.  I'm no advocate for
beating, but occasionally a boy in the puppy stage
is better for it."
</p>

<p>
"Father is too old and too lenient.  Besides, he's
my responsibility," said Betty, with a little laugh
that had tears behind it.
</p>

<p>
"You should send him home."
</p>

<p>
"I would if my brother-in-law had anyone there
to mother him, although I should be sending half
my heart with him."
</p>

<p>
"Well, depend upon it he's only passing through
one of the rather tiresome stages of development,
which every man-child experiences in a more or
less degree."
</p>

<p>
"But which it needs a man's hand to guide him
through."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not at all sure that a mother's or aunt's
influence does not go further," said Tom consolingly,
"but I shall be here for a few weeks now, and will
do what I can.  Besides, I'm so fond of the boy.
I don't think little Jack the Englishman can have
gone far astray.  Does your present clergyman
have much to say to him?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Curtis?" answered Betty.  "He's quite a
good man and a very hard worker, but he has no
knack with children.  He is shy of them, and the
feeling is mutual."
</p>

<p>
"And does Jack ring the bell still?" Tom asked,
with a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"No, he got late one or two Sundays, and
Mr. Curtis told him that if he could not be there in
time he would rather ring it himself.  The novelty
and honour of the thing had worn off a little, and
Jack would not go any more and I did not think
it wise to force him."
</p>

<p>
"But he goes to church?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, he goes with me, and to Sunday School
also.  He announced last Sunday that he was
getting too old to go to Sunday School, but I
promptly sat on him."
</p>

<p>
"To sum up the matter, Master Jack has grown
a little too big for his boots."
</p>

<p>
"Metaphorically and literally," Betty answered
smiling.  "He's such a big boy for his age and very
manly; he is always out-growing his suits.  People
often take him for twelve or thirteen, and he's
only eleven, and as it has always been his ambition
to be big, he assumes the airs of boys much older
than himself."
</p>

<p>
Then Tom led Betty's thoughts to other channels,
told her something of his own travels and experiences,
and left her at last refreshed and soothed.  But
all Betty had told him about Jack troubled him
rather.  The boy must be summarily dealt with.
Jack was terribly chagrined in the morning
when he heard that Uncle Tom had arrived, and
had asked to see him.

JACK, WITH HIS FACE SKYWARD, SMOKING A CIGARETTE. p. 109
</p>

<p>
"What did you say, Aunt Betty?"
</p>

<p>
"I had to tell him the truth, that I had sent
you to bed because you'd been naughty," said
Betty, quietly.  "I'd run off directly after
breakfast and find him, if I were you."
</p>

<p>
But Jack's conscience made a coward of him,
and instead of seeking Uncle Tom he ran off to a
far corner of the farm and threw himself behind a
stack, angry with himself and all the world.
Half-an-hour later, Tom, sauntering about the farm in
search of him, saw a tiny thread of smoke blown
round the corner of the stack, and, peering round
the corner, discovered Jack stretched full length
along the ground, with his face skyward, smoking
a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
At the sound of a footstep Jack sprang to his
feet, thrusting the cigarette into his pocket, turned
scarlet and then very white, and came forward
with a slightly sheepish expression.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Uncle Tom, I'm jolly glad to see you,"
he said, stretching out a brown paw.  "I'm&mdash;&mdash;"
and then he came to a pause, disconcerted by the
smiling gaze fixed upon him.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I disturbed you in the luxury of a
quiet smoke," said Tom, seating himself with his
back against the stack.  "A new accomplishment,
eh! Jack?"
</p>

<p>
Jack's face was sickly green now.  "I was not
smoking," he said, avoiding the scrutiny of Tom's
eyes.  "I was only going to light a bonfire."
</p>

<p>
The answer was more serious than Tom had
believed.  The boy lied, and Tom's heart was hot
within him, but his voice was almost alarmingly
quiet.
</p>

<p>
"Let's have a look at your pockets, old man.
I would rather like to see what you've got in them."
</p>

<p>
"I won't," said Jack, stung into defiance.
"You're not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not Uncle Tom, were you going to say?"
went on Tom Chance.  "It was a pretence relationship,
just a baby's whim to call me so.  All right,
Jack, so be it, but it is not the welcome I expected
from my friend, Jack the Englishman," and he
turned to go, but Jack sprang after him, seizing
him by the hand.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go, please don't go, Uncle Tom.  I did
not mean it, really.  I'm truly awf'ly glad to see
you, but it's treating me like a baby to tell me
to turn out my pockets."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Jack," said Tom, turning upon him
a face nearly as white as his own, "you know quite
well why I wanted to see into your pocket.  It's
because I wanted to prove that you've lied to me.
You were smoking, which only showed you to be a
silly little ass.  That could soon have been mended
by a straight talk, but you told a lie to cover it,
and that can't be mended.  You'll carry the stain
of that lie to your life's end.  I'm deeply, bitterly,
disappointed in you, and if you were my real nephew
I'd beat you with the greatest pleasure in life."
</p>

<p>
Jack lifted sullen, unrepentant eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Beat me," he said, "beat me, and have done
with it."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Tom.  "Even that would not make
things level.  You are neither sorry nor ashamed."
</p>

<p>
He watched the knot climb into the boy's throat,
he could almost see the fight between the evil and
good spirit in his heart, and doubted which would
conquer.  He could but admire the boy's outward
appearance, his splendid physique, his handsome
head set so firmly on his broad shoulders, but the
charm of the child that knows no evil was his no
longer.
</p>

<p>
"Jack," said Tom again, "if you are giving me
a sore heart, what will you give your father?  How
will you look him in the face if you can't speak the
truth and shame the devil?"
</p>

<p>
Jack's arm went up as if to ward off a blow;
he tried to speak but choked in the effort, and then
he threw himself face forward on the grass, and
was sobbing as if his heart would break, and Tom
gave a long sigh of relief, for he knew the evil spirit
had departed.  He suffered Jack to cry for quite a
long time.  At last he bent over him, and touched
him on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Sit up, Jack.  Suppose we have a talk, and
see what's gone wrong with you?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't," said Jack, still hiding his face.  "I
feel such a beast."
</p>

<p>
"But I want to find out what's making you feel
like that."
</p>

<p>
"And you'll hate me for ever and ever," said
Jack, disclosing one scarlet eye.
</p>

<p>
"God forbid," said Tom, solemnly.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't mean to tell&mdash;a lie"&mdash;Jack's tongue
stumbled over the disgraceful word&mdash;"I thought
you'd be angry with me for smoking and I said I
wasn't, all in a hurry, but I <i>wish</i> I hadn't."
</p>

<p>
"So do I," interposed Tom.
</p>

<p>
"But you can have it, you can have 'em all,"
and Jack rose to his feet and fumbled in both his
pockets, producing a dirty little pocket handkerchief,
with which he mopped his eyes, a ball of twine, which
he threw impatiently on the ground, and finally a
box of matches and a half-smoked cigarette.  He
handed the cigarette and the matches to Tom with
a shaking hand, who put them into his own pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me how you got it?"
</p>

<p>
"I bought 'em out of my pocket money."
</p>

<p>
"Then you've smoked before?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, four times, but it made me&mdash;rather ill.
I wanted to smoke until the chaps at school could
see I could.  They said I was a kid and couldn't.
I wanted 'em to see I could do the same as they
did."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me you've been an uncommonly
silly little boy, not a bit better than a monkey that
tries to copy all its companions' silly tricks.  Nothing
seems to me quite so ridiculous as a boy who tries
to be a man before his time, and it's wrong as well.
You can spoil the splendid health and body God
has given you by beginning to smoke too soon.
And do the big boys you are so anxious to copy
tell lies, too, and cheat at lessons?  Are you learning
that as well?"
</p>

<p>
Jack quivered as if Tom had hit him.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't lied until now.  I wish you'd beat me."
</p>

<p>
Instead, Tom caught him in his arms, and held
him fast a minute.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for that.  At least we can thank Him
for that, that it is your first, and, let us trust, your
last lie.  I could not love or trust a boy whose word
I could not believe, but you've got out of the right
road, boy, and you must come back again.  You've
altered strangely from the little boy I left behind me."
</p>

<p>
"I've grown big," said Jack, a little resentfully.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and you fancy yourself much bigger than
you are.  Lots of little things tell me that, although
I only came back last night.  You've thrown over
your chum, you are troublesome to Aunt Betty,
you fancy yourself too big for Sunday School&mdash;as
if we were ever, any of us, too big to go on learning
how to serve and please God!  You've got to
relearn that you're just a little boy, who, if he ever
means to be of any good in the world and be a
real man, must learn first himself to be obedient,
brave; and truthful, and must keep his own course
straight, however crooked other boys may go.
Have you forgotten about your Confirmation,
Jack?  You were keen about it when I went away."
</p>

<p>
"I don't care so much about it now."
</p>

<p>
"What has made you change your mind?"
</p>

<p>
"Dick Chambers says it's all silly rot, only fit
for girls, and does them no good.  Mr. Curtis came
after him and asked him about it, and he said he
would not go to the classes for anything."
</p>

<p>
"Humph, and you'd rather take Dick Chambers'
opinion than Mr. Curtis's, or mine, or Aunt Betty's.
But we can leave the matter of your Confirmation
alone at present.  Come along, now, and take me
over the farm, and show me all the changes since
I went away."
</p>

<p>
Jack obeyed the summons readily enough.  It
was an enormous relief to talk of something else,
and something of the misery of the morning faded
in the fascination of Tom's companionship, but as
they finally neared the house Jack drew back a little.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom, shall you tell Aunt Betty?"
</p>

<p>
"No, the telling is yours, not mine."
</p>

<p>
"Whom must I tell?"
</p>

<p>
"God first and ask Him to forgive you, and
your father, and ask him the same thing."
</p>

<p>
Jack winced.  "Write it down; write down that
I've smoked and told a lie?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, put it down in black and white and look
at it.  It will make you remember, and I don't
fancy you will do either again."
</p>

<p>
The letter to father was written next day, and
Jack drank his cup of humiliation to the dregs as
he handed the letter, as usual, to Aunt Betty with
a crimson face.
</p>

<p>
"You can read it if you like," he said.
</p>

<p>
"You'll be very sorry to hear that I've told a lie
and smoked four cigarettes, but I promise faithfully
not to do it any more.  Uncle Tom said I must
tell you and God."
</p>

<p>
Betty laughed and cried over that letter at the
same time, and thanked God that Uncle Tom had
come back just in time to bring little Jack to
repentance.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br /><br />
A BUSH TOUR
</h3>

<p>
Tom did not propose to spend his four or five weeks
of holiday in idleness.  Whilst making his sister's
house his headquarters, he determined to revisit
such places as lay within reach, and would start
off with his knapsack on his back, taking a two or
three days' tour at a time.
</p>

<p>
"Why can't I walk with you?" Jack asked one
day, wistfully.  "I'm ever so strong on my legs!"
</p>

<p>
"Not strong enough for that," said Tom, but it
set him thinking what to do to brighten Jack's
holiday.  The boy was manfully doing his best;
had reinstated himself in Eva's good graces by a
renewal of friendship and a demand for her
companionship, but having tasted the strong drink of
the fellowship of boys there was no question that
to go back to a girl playmate was a little like sipping
milk and water.  His manner to Aunt Betty
changed from the confiding affection of infancy to
an obedient deference that she found distinctly
attractive, for Uncle Tom was constantly impressing
upon him by precept and example, that all women
should command gentleness and respect from the
masculine sex, so that not again had Betty to
complain of rude answers or disobedience.  What
had passed between Jack and Tom she could only
dimly guess, but the result of Tom's treatment
was entirely satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
One morning Tom presented himself at the farm
quite early in the day.
</p>

<p>
"I've a plan to unfold, and I want your consent
before I speak to Jack about it," he said.  He had
followed Betty to the dairy where she was busy
among her milk pans, and stood leaning against
the door-post.
</p>

<p>
"Your treatment of him proves so entirely
salutary that you have my consent before I even
guess what your plan may be," she said, looking up
at him with smiling eyes.
</p>

<p>
"That's good hearing.  I have hired a horse for
a week, and am going to take a riding tour to various
townships and outlying farms that are beyond my
reach on foot, and I should like to take Jack with
me.  Is there any pony on the farm that he could
borrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Father has let him ride Tim lately.  Tim has
quieted with age, and though still full of spirit,
seldom indulges in tricks.  I don't know if the pony
could be spared for so long, but it would be so big
a joy to Jack that I feel as if father is certain to
consent."
</p>

<p>
"Where may your father be found?  I'll go
and ask him.  I want to get off quickly while the
day is fairly cool.  Meanwhile, will you put up in
Jack's school knapsack such things as are absolutely
needful for a few days' bush riding?  Make it as
light as you can."
</p>

<p>
"You are accepting father's consent as a foregone
conclusion."
</p>

<p>
"I think so; it's his own fault that I do so.
He never yet has refused me anything I've asked."
</p>

<p>
Jack was nearly wild with joy when, half-an-hour
later, he and Tom were trotting down the green lane
side by side.  He turned in his saddle to wave his
cap to Eva and her mother who stood watching
their departure from the gate, then settled himself
in his seat with a quivering sigh of enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
"It's just splendid of you to have thought of it.
Just think of riding with you for a whole week.  I
wish it were for ever and ever."
</p>

<p>
Tom laughed over Jack's enthusiasm.  "I expect
we should both get pretty tired of it and of each
other then, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't," declared Jack, stoutly, putting
Tim into a canter.  "I'd never be tired of being
with you.  You're the jolliest grown-up I've ever
seen except father.  I'd like to stay with you until
I can go to him.  It's queer he doesn't want me
now.  I keep on telling him in every letter how
big I am.  Where are we going to first?"
</p>

<p>
"I propose to ride first to Jessie's home.  We
shall drop in there just about dinner-time."
</p>

<p>
"How jolly!  We've seen her several times
since we saw you.  She comes down here about
once a year.  She's left Wylmington School ever
so long, and has gone as second teacher in a girls'
school in Launceston, so I don't expect we'll find
her."
</p>

<p>
"You forget it will be her holiday time too.  I
often hear from her, and she seems to have grown
quite strong."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and Aunt Betty says she's pretty," said
Jack, who had no opinion of his own about girls'
looks at present.
</p>

<p>
The ride for the first eight miles was entirely
normal, along beautifully engineered roads which
climbed ever up and up by zig-zag courses through
the hill forests to Wylmington.  Beyond were the
falls which in summer-time were a favourite resort
for picnic parties, but, leaving them to the right,
Tom followed one of the bush roads bearing to the
left, which was nothing more than a cart track, in
some places almost overgrown, and in others, where
more clearing had been done, opened out into a
glorious view of surrounding hills.  As they rode
along Tom told Jack of his experience the last time
he had passed that way in a gale of wind and rain,
and how he had been weather-bound for the night
at Woodlands, Jessie's home.
</p>

<p>
"We won't stop there to-night, will we?" asked
Jack, whose one idea was to put as great a distance
between himself and home as possible.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I want to get on to the next homestead,
about ten miles further on, but it will be slow going,
as there is little more than a bridle-track to travel
by, and we could easily lose our way."
</p>

<p>
"What fun!  I hope we shall."
</p>

<p>
"I don't," said Tom.  "It's no laughing matter
to be lost in the bush.  It's a very lonesome spot
we are going to, and we shall probably sleep in a
shakedown in the barn."
</p>

<p>
Jack gave a joyous laugh of anticipation, but
here they were in sight of Woodlands, and he sprang
from his pony to open the gate which separated the
home clearing from the bush.  Before they rode up
to the door Jessie had caught a glimpse of them and
came running towards them with a radiant face.  She
had changed from a girl to a young woman and a pretty
young woman too, Tom thought, as he dismounted
and one of the boys came forward to take his horse.
</p>

<p>
"We'll off-saddle them for an hour or two if we
may," he said, "and we've counted on Woodlands
hospitality to give us something to eat."
</p>

<p>
"But of course," cried Jessie joyously.  "I told
mother that the feeling in my bones meant
something good was to happen to-day, but I never
thought of anything half so good as this."
</p>

<p>
Then came the farmer and his wife to welcome
their guests.  The family dinner was over and the
boys dispersed about the farm, but a meal of sorts
should be ready in a brace of shakes, and the
"nipper" looked ready for it, which the nipper was,
for the ride had given him a hearty appetite.  And
whilst Jessie flitted to and fro in hospitable
preparation, Tom noticed the stamp of refinement which
illness had left upon her, but there was something
more than refinement written on her face&mdash;a certain
radiance which he accepted as the outward
manifestation of an inward grace, a heart at peace with
God and all the world.
</p>

<p>
"You found the right work for the girl," said
the farmer, following the direction of Tom's eyes.
"She just dotes on her teaching, and gets on well
with it.  We shall have her up here some day, I
expect, setting us all to rights as school-teacher at
Wylmington."
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, father," laughed Jessie, shaking her
finger at him.  "I want to know ever so much more
before I try for a school of my own."
</p>

<p>
"And will it be a school in the bush when that
time comes?" Tom asked.  "Time was when you
did not like the Bush much."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; being away from them all makes
you long to be back, though a town school, where I
am now, teaches you a lot about discipline and such
things, but sometimes now I think I'll get back to
the country, where you can get to know all your
children and love them and have care of them out
of school as well as in it.  And one can do
something for the church in these country places.  I'm
learning to play the harmonium, and I could play
perhaps on Sundays when we have service.  There's
no one to do it now, not even anyone who can lead
the singing.  Don't you remember how you said
once that it was a clergyman's work to set the
machinery in a place going, the spiritual machinery,
and the work of the people to keep it alive and
active?"
</p>

<p>
"Did I say that?  You can't expect me to
remember all I said four years ago."
</p>

<p>
"But I remember, because you were the first one
to talk to me about the church's order.  You said
most people left their religion to chance and odd
times, and we ought to be as careful over it as over
our other work."
</p>

<p>
"You were an attentive pupil, it seems," said
Tom, smiling at her.
</p>

<p>
"Because you put things clearly so that I could
understand them," said Jessie simply.  "When you
went away and I could not talk to you any more,
I wrote down a good many things you said, so as to
teach them to my class in the Sunday School."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are a Sunday School teacher?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, for over three years now.  I love it
best of any of my teaching, and the Sunday School
is all alive where I am now.  Here I found it very
difficult to get the children to care."
</p>

<p>
Jack had slipped away with Jessie's father to see
a fresh brood of chickens, which gave Tom an
opportunity of some talk with Jessie about her work, but
presently he looked at his watch and said they must
be moving on, but, before the horses were re-saddled,
Mrs. Butler insisted upon a cup of tea, and sent
them on their way with a well-filled wallet of
provisions in case they got detained upon the road.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Is</i> Jessie pretty?" Jack inquired, as they rode
upon their way.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think she is, but she's more than pretty:
she's good."
</p>

<p>
"How d'you know?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"By her look&mdash;goodness, like evil, writes itself
upon people's faces, Jack&mdash;by her ways and by her
words," said Tom.
</p>

<p>
The saying did not altogether please Jack.
</p>

<p>
"It's rather horrid people can tell whether you
are good or bad by looking at you," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Then you must take care only to do and think
such things as will give you a good face," said Tom,
with a little laugh, and then he began talking about
other things.
</p>

<p>
How the week sped, a week which Jack was old
enough now to look back upon with pleasure all his
days!  It was an unusually hot and dry year for
Tasmania, and the sun, beating upon the forests and rich
undergrowth through which they rode day after day,
brought out a pungent fragrance that acted like a
tonic, preventing any consciousness of fatigue.  There
was a sense of adventure, too, in travelling by these
unknown and little trodden tracks that was quite
delightful to a boy, and delightful also was Tom's
companionship, and in fuller measure came back
his old ascendancy over Jack.  Before it had been
the affection of a little child, but now it took the
form of a boy's hero-worship, the wish to grow into
a man something like Uncle Tom or father.  The
mere fact that Tom could turn his hand to almost
anything was a deep source of admiration, from
lighting a fire to shoeing a horse.  And Tom on his
side grew deeply attached to the little boy, whose
pluck and courage might have belonged to a boy
twice his age, whose interest in all he saw or heard
was so singularly alive, and quite unconsciously his
influence for good over the boy almost every hour of
the day was making itself felt.  It was more from what
he did than what he said, although with a man like
Tom, whose first object and aim in life was to serve
God himself and to teach others to serve, it was
scarcely possible to live with him many days
without some mention of higher things.  The mention
of such things might pass unnoticed, but the fact
that when they passed one or two nights in a shed
together, Jack saw Tom kneel down and say his
prayers with absorbing earnestness before he crept
into his bed of straw, was an object-lesson Jack
could not well forget.  And again, when they woke
in the morning, Tom's hand searched in the
knapsack which had served as his pillow for the
Testament he always carried about with him, and he
would read aloud to Jack some parable, or miracle,
said or worked by our Lord, and invest it with an
entirely new character, making Jack feel it a reality
instead of something written in an old book that
might or might not be true.  On the last morning
of their tour, as they sat together on the bole of a
huge forest tree that had been felled and left lying
along the ground until such time as it was carted
away, Tom chose for the morning reading the
account in the Acts of the churches that had not
yet received any open manifestation of the Spirit,
and of how the Apostles were sent for to bestow the
great gift.
</p>

<p>
"And that is what we now call Confirmation,
Jack, that is the Bible teaching about it.  I wonder
if anyone ever showed Dick Chambers that passage,
or tried to make it clear to him.  He might change
his mind about its being all stuff and nonsense."
</p>

<p>
Jack coloured a little.
</p>

<p>
"But everyone who is confirmed isn't good,
Uncle Tom."
</p>

<p>
"I don't say they are, Jack; I only tell you it is
a great help, a gift of God that I want every boy
and girl baptised in our church to look forward to
and get ready for.  If you use a gift it may help you
immensely; if you neglect it or throw it away that
is not God's fault: it's yours."
</p>

<p>
Jack did not make any answer; Tom did not
know if he even understood, but from that day
forward Jack renewed his determination to be
confirmed some day, when he was old enough, "same
as Jessie was."  Perhaps it was Jessie's confirmation
that helped to give her a "good face," in which
conjecture there was more truth than little Jack
was aware of.
</p>

<p>
And that evening found the companions at home
again, Jack very bronzed and voluble about all his
experiences of the different places they had stayed
at, and of the almost wild children they had come
across, of the snakes they had killed in the bush, of
their picnic meals, etc.; but, of the things that had
gone deepest, of his talks with Uncle Tom and of
the way Uncle Tom said his prayers, he never spoke
at all.  They had sunk too deep to come up to the
surface.  But Eva, as he talked to her, bemoaned
the fate that, in making her a girl, cut her off from
all these delightful pleasures.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom, we ought to have a blow-up for
Eva before you go," Jack said one day soon after
their return.  "It <i>is</i> rather dull being a girl, you
know.  Could not we have a picnic a long way off
on Thursday?  It's my birthday; I shall be twelve
years old, but we could pretend it was Eva's."
</p>

<p>
Uncle Tom was rather pleased at this budding
thoughtfulness for Jack's chum, and caught readily
at the notion.
</p>

<p>
"We'll talk to my sister and Aunt Betty and see
what can be done," he said.  "Has Eva ever been
to Wylmington Falls?  If not, we could hire a brake,
get some of the neighbours to join us, and we'll call
it Eva's party."
</p>

<p>
The notion caught on like wildfire, and Eva herself
was in ecstasies of delight.  She watched every
cloudlet that flecked the sky with grave forebodings
lest the longed-for day should prove wet.
</p>

<p>
"Not a chance of it," said Uncle Tom.  "The
farmers are all longing for rain to save their crops,
which bush fires are constantly destroying," but that
rain should fall on Thursday was more than he or
any of the others could wish.  And it did not rain!
Never was a more perfect day for a picnic.  The
families at the farm and the cottage were early astir,
for everybody was coming except Mr. Treherne, who
had to stay behind for the task of looking after the
animals, for it was to be a real long summer holiday,
beginning with dinner directly they arrived, and
closing with tea before their return, which would
give the horses a nice long rest.  So soon after
eleven the brake started off with Mrs. Kenyon,
Mrs. Treherne, Betty, and all the provisions packed
in hampers, and behind came the pony cart from
the farm driven by Tom, with Jack and Eva tucked
in by the side of him, and various other vehicles
joined them on the way, carrying invited guests, so
that it was quite a cavalcade that wound its way
along the circuitous road, and there was much
laughter and rivalry as to who should take the lead,
and who could keep it, and for one proud triumphant
moment Tom and the pony led the way, to be superseded
very quickly by the brake with its stout pair
of horses.  But for the long, long climb at the end,
all were reduced to walking, and many of the
passengers got out, amongst them the children,
who plunged into the bush below and above them,
bringing back handfuls of flowers and berries.
</p>

<p>
"And this afternoon, Eva, whilst the others are
lazing about, you and I will go blackberrying in the
bush.  We'll make a surprise for Aunt Betty, who'll
be awfully pleased when we bring back a lot of
berries ready for jam," said Jack magnanimously,
determined to make the day altogether delightful
for Eva.
</p>

<p>
"How lovely!" said Eva.  "Don't forget we're to
keep it a secret.  No one shall guess what we mean
to do."
</p>

<p>
But now the carriages had turned into the rough
track which led to the famous falls, whose nearness
proclaimed itself by a distant roar of falling water,
a sound which mingled with the swirl of the river
under the bridge they had just driven over.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of a mile through the green overgrown
track brought them to a large clearing, where open
sheds had been built for the special benefit of
picnicers, where a general halt was called, and whilst
the men busied themselves in taking out their horses
and giving them a rub down before securing them
in the sheds, the women and children collected fuel
for the fire, but Jack and Eva, fascinated by the
sound of the falling water, stole off hand in hand
to obtain a nearer view of the Falls.  Arched over
their heads was a long avenue of tree ferns, under
their feet the rocks and stones which the winter
floods brought with them, but now the river had
withdrawn to its natural bed, and an exquisite
undergrowth of flowers and maidenhair fern
concealed the roughness of the way.  More than once
Eva would have lost her footing but for Jack's hand,
but at last they reached the point where they could
obtain their first full view of the falls, three separate
cascades of foaming, sparkling water growing greater
and stronger in its fall, until it lost itself in the
turbulent river below.
</p>

<p>
"One would not have much chance if one fell in,"
said Jack.
</p>

<p>
"No, it's lovely, but it frightens me and makes
me giddy to look at it.  Take me back to the
others," Eva answered.
</p>

<p>
Jack longed to linger, longed to scale the rough
ladders set against the hill, which would lead him
up to the higher falls, but the day was Eva's, and he
turned and gave her his hand.
</p>

<p>
"It's a dreadful pity you're not a boy," was all
he said.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br /><br />
A NARROW ESCAPE
</h3>

<p>
After the mid-day meal people agreed to separate
and go their several ways.  A goodly number
proposed to climb up to the second and third falls,
an impossible feat until lately, when the touring
club had provided upright fixed ladders to scale
the most inaccessible places, but the ladders were
steep and slippery with damp, and it was only the
younger and more venturesome of the party who
proffered for the excursion.
</p>

<p>
"I shall want to take a few snapshots.  They
tell me the falls, viewed from the top, are simply
magnificent," said Tom, slinging his camera across
his shoulders.  "Jack, you shall come with us.  I'll
answer for your safety," with a kindly hand laid on
the boy's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"I can't unless Eva is going too.  I've promised
to be with her this afternoon, as it's her day, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"Eva!" laughed Eva's mother.  "Eva won't
go, will you, pussy?  She's the most arrant little
coward in the world, but, encouraged by Betty, I
mean to venture, Tom, and it will take all your time
to look after me.  Betty can look after herself."
</p>

<p>
"I should think so," said Betty, with fine scorn.
"I should be ashamed of myself if I needed help
to climb a few ladders."
</p>

<p>
It was with eyes of longing regret that Jack
watched the party start off through the aisle of tree
ferns and heard their merry voices gradually dying
away in the distance, but Eva's hand tugged at his.
</p>

<p>
"It was just splendid of you, Jack, to stay with
me instead of going with them, and now, as mother
and Aunt Betty are gone, we need ask no one's
leave to go off by ourselves."
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," said Jack, a little shortly, still
smarting with the pain of refusal.  "I'm big enough
to take care of a girl half your age."
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Treherne and various other matrons drew
out their work and their books and settled themselves
on a green oasis not far from the river, where
they could catch a glimpse of it as it rushed in
headlong impetuosity towards the valleys below, and
the children slipped away through the trees towards
the bridge which they must recross on their way to
the bush track which Jack had traversed with Tom
only a few days ago.
</p>

<p>
"But how lovely this is!" said Eva, peering into
the recesses of the bush on either side.  "We can
pretend that all sorts of things are happening; that
we've lost our way, you and I, and&mdash;and&mdash;the best
of pretending things is that you've all the fun of
things happening and never get frightened.  We
might pretend that it was night, and that we'd had
nothing to eat all day."
</p>

<p>
But Jack, a matter-of-fact schoolboy, whose days
of pretending were over, had little patience with all
these fancies.
</p>

<p>
"But where's the good of pretending when we
aren't lost, and when we've had tons to eat?  I'll tell
you what isn't pretence.  If you went on along this
track through a big clearing which we shall come to
presently, you would reach Woodlands, Jessie's
home."
</p>

<p>
"Could we get there?" said Eva excitedly.
"I'd rather see Jessie than gather cartloads of
blackberries."
</p>

<p>
"That's the worst of girls," retorted Jack.  "You
never know what they want!  Which would you
<i>really</i> rather do&mdash;get blackberries or go to Jessie,
for it's flat we can't do both?"
</p>

<p>
Eva hesitated, moving restlessly from one foot
to the other.
</p>

<p>
"Well, speak up! blackberries or Jessie? for, if
you choose Jessie, we've no time to lose.  It's a
goodish distance."
</p>

<p>
"Could I walk it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think you could."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, let's make for Jessie.  She <i>will</i> be
surprised to see us, more surprised even than when
you went with Uncle Tom, because, you see, you
were on horseback, and I'm only on my legs.  She'll
wonder how on earth I got there," and Eva gave
an anticipatory chuckle at the thought of the
astonishment her appearance would create.
</p>

<p>
It was rough walking through the bush, and
Eva's legs began to ache a little.
</p>

<p>
"Is it a great deal further, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"We're only about half way there.  I believe
we'd better go back, though we shall look rather
fools having done neither one thing nor the other,"
but the suggestion of turning back did not please
his companion.
</p>

<p>
"Let's rest a little, and then I'll get on all right.
There's heaps of time before us," so they sat with
their backs supported against the trunk of a tree,
whilst Jack told stories of his late experiences.  At
last he sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"And now if we mean to get there at all this
afternoon," he said, "we must be getting on, unless
you would rather go back."
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll go on; Jessie will be so surprised,"
reiterated Eva, and the children little knew that
the decision, made so lightly, possibly saved both
their lives.  As they neared the clearing which was
only about a mile and a half from Jessie's home,
Jack became aware of a distant fitful roar that he
could only imagine was the rising of the wind before
a coming storm, and wondered within himself what
he could do with Eva in such a predicament.
</p>

<p>
"The sun's gone in and the sky's all
copper-coloured," said Eva, as they emerged into open
country, "I believe it's going to thunder;" but
Jack's quick eyes, glancing towards the horizon,
saw flames partially concealed by smoke leaping
and dancing through the bush, and knew that for
the first time in his life he was within reach of a
bush fire.  He had watched many a one with delight
from the safe distance of his grandfather's farm, but
to see one racing towards him, urged on by a wind
behind, was a wholly different matter, and it was
the far-off roar of flames that he had heard, and
even Jack's brave little heart quailed before the
danger which threatened them, but it was of Eva's
safety that he thought rather than his own, and the
sense of responsibility weighed heavily upon him.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-131"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-131.jpg" alt="THEY RACED ALONG HAND IN HAND. p. 131" />
<br />
THEY RACED ALONG HAND IN HAND. p. 131
</p>

<p>
Two courses seemed open to him; either to turn
back or to push on at all possible speed towards
Woodlands, and once more he turned to see which
direction the fire was taking, and was alarmed to
find that retreat was impossible, for the wind was
carrying the flames along the forest of ringed trees
and dried undergrowth through which they had just
come at such terrific speed that long before they could
get back by the way they had come they would be
caught in the flames.  Not only so, but the whole fire
was widening its course, creeping across the clearing
to the half-felled wood on the other side, licking up
everything that came in its way, so that they stood
in a half circle of fire, and might find themselves
surrounded unless fleetness of foot and coolness of
brain could save them.
</p>

<p>
All this flashed through Jack's brain with the
rapidity of lightning.
</p>

<p>
"Eva," he said, speaking as quietly as he could,
"we must hurry up a bit; that fire is coming our
way.  Give us your hand!  We must get along as
fast as ever we can."
</p>

<p>
But Eva stood stock still, looking round with
eyes dilated with terror.
</p>

<p>
"Take me back, Jack!  Oh! how I wish we had
never come."
</p>

<p>
"We can't get back," Jack answered with a little
thrill in his voice.  "You mustn't cry, Eva!  There's
no time to cry.  Be a brick, do as I tell you, and
<i>don't be afraid</i>!  We'll get through all right."
</p>

<p>
Something of Jack's high courage gave Eva fresh
heart, and they raced along hand in hand, but Jack
though he spoke cheerily, was fully aware of their
danger; the roaring of the fire drew ever nearer
and nearer; clouds of smoke and sparks flew close
on their heels, and the glowing heat of the wind was
making itself felt very unpleasantly.
</p>

<p>
Presently Eva released the hand that dragged her
along with a gasp.
</p>

<p>
"I can't, I can't," she cried, with sobbing breath.
"I can't run another yard."
</p>

<p>
"You'll get your second wind in a minute," said
Jack, almost in despair.  "Look here!"&mdash;sinking
on to his knees.  "Climb up, climb up I say.  I'll
carry you on my back," and almost before she knew
what he did he had hoisted her on to his shoulders,
but with all the will in the world it was only for a
very short distance that he could carry her.  The
perspiration was dripping from his head and face,
and Eva saw it and knew he was nearly played out.
</p>

<p>
"Let me down," she said, struggling to free
herself.  "My breath is coming back.  I'll run again
now."
</p>

<p>
"All right," Jack said, slipping her gently to the
ground.  "Keep your pecker up!  We shall beat
the old fire yet!  D'you see that it's coming up
slowly this way and turning away from where
Woodlands is yonder?  Another few minutes, if we
can keep up the pace, we'll be out of its reach," so
half walking, half running, they hurried on again,
casting fearful glances backwards and around to see
if the flames were gaining ground.  Presently Jack
threw up his arms with a wild hurrah.
</p>

<p>
"We're through, Eva, we're through all right!
I hear the cries of the beaters fighting back the
flames," and true enough, at some distance from
them were the farmer and his sons and a neighbour
or two who had hurried to the rescue, beating back
the flames which, snake-like, were creeping
insidiously along towards the farmer's crops.
</p>

<p>
All danger of being surrounded now by the fire
was over, and the wayworn travellers proceeded
more leisurely to the homestead, which was close at
hand, but as Jack's fingers wrestled with the latch of
the gate, he found them trembling so much as to be
almost beyond control.  They were scarcely inside
it, before Mrs. Butler and Jessie, who stood watching
the progress of the fire in the verandah, recognised
them and hurried down to meet them.
</p>

<p>
"Jack!  Eva!" cried Jessie, and the surprise in
her tone was even greater than Eva had pictured
it, but the poor child was far too worn out with
fatigue and excitement to understand anything but
that she was with friends and in a place of safety.
She threw out her arms to Jessie with a little cry,
and the next moment was sobbing her very heart
out on her shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"But where do you come from?" asked Mrs. Butler,
looking down on Jack's quivering face.
</p>

<p>
"From Wylmington Falls.  We came up there&mdash;a
lot of us&mdash;for a picnic, and it suddenly came into
our heads, Eva's and mine, that we'd walk on and
pay you a surprise visit, but we've been racing the
fire, and she's about done for."
</p>

<p>
"Poor lamb!  Give her to me," said Mrs. Butler,
stretching out her arms for Eva.  "The child is half
dead with terror and fatigue.  We'll put her to bed
at once, and she'll sleep it off."
</p>

<p>
But a fresh terror presented itself to Jack's mind.
What would those they had left behind them think
of their non-appearance?  Aunt Betty was not one
to make a fuss, but if he and Eva did not come that
night, Jack, boy as he was, guessed something of the
pain she would endure, and there was Eva's mother
as well.  Something must be done to let them know
that they were safe, but what did not yet appear.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The party at the falls were detained much longer
than they expected on their climb.  First one or
two of them were anxious to obtain the very best
possible views of the upper cascades, and their
companions were quite willing to rest whilst the
photographers were at work, and then, in descending from
the topmost fall, Clarissa slipped, wrenching her
ankle rather severely, and first handkerchiefs were
sacrificed to make a bandage, and then it was a
matter of real difficulty to get her down the
remainder of the way, so that it was nearly two hours
before the company were reassembled for tea.
Mrs. Kenyon, who was in considerable pain, was made as
comfortable as possible in an improvised easy chair
of cushions and brake fern, and the party scattered
in different directions, collecting wood for the fire
whilst Tom carried off the billy to the river to fill, in
readiness for tea.
</p>

<p>
"Cooey for the children, will you?" said Betty,
lifting a hot face from the fire she was coaxing into
ablaze.  "The idle rogues should have had this all
ready for us.  Jack is a famous boy for a fire."
</p>

<p>
So Tom returned to the river, looking up and
down its banks for the children, who he felt sure
were not far off, and sent a long cooey ringing down
the water, but no answer came to his call.
</p>

<p>
"I can't see them anywhere," he said, returning
to Betty.
</p>

<p>
"How tiresome of them to have wandered so far.
I wonder what direction they have taken.  Mother,
did you see Jack and Eva go off together?  Do
you know what has become of them?"
</p>

<p>
"I fancy I caught sight of them hurrying off
towards the bridge," said another lady.  "Jack
had a basket slung on his back, so depend upon it
they were in search of berries of sorts.  There are a
good many ripening just now in the bush."
</p>

<p>
"Here, mother, put in the tea; the billy is
boiling," said Betty.  "I'll just run up towards the
bridge and have a look for them."
</p>

<p>
"I'd come with you if I weren't as lame as a
duck," said Clarissa, "but ever since the bullock
incident, I've always felt Eva as safe with Jack as
with a man."
</p>

<p>
"I'll come," said Tom.  "You shall look in one
direction, and I in another.  It's impossible that
they can be very far away," and he took his place
at Betty's side.
</p>

<p>
"How oppressive the day has become! or is it that
I'm hurried, and a little flurried as well?" Betty
said with an uneasy laugh.  "I'm not a nervous
woman, but I confess I'm rather frightened at the
children not being here, and I'm blaming myself
also for having left them so long."
</p>

<p>
"Depend upon it we shall see them coming over
the bridge lugging an enormous basket of
blackberries.  Eva was full of importance over some
secret scheme that she and Jack were going to
carry out, and it may have taken longer than
they calculated, as our expedition did this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
The commonplace suggestion soothed Betty without
quite satisfying her.  Tom threw up his head
suddenly, scenting the hot air.
</p>

<p>
"The heat is explained also, I think, by the fact
that there must be a bush fire not very far away.  I
smell the delicious pungency of its burning, and the
coppery look of the clouds veiling the sun suggests
smoke."
</p>

<p>
"A bush fire near here," said Betty, turning a
white face on him.  "You don't think that by any
chance the children have wandered into the bush
and&mdash;&mdash;" her tongue clicked against the roof of her
mouth, refusing to voice her fears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear no," said Tom ready to bite out his
own tongue at having hinted at the fire.  "I feel
that they have wandered far down the river,
possibly to some haunt Jack thought a likely one
for blackberries."
</p>

<p>
That suggestion did not comfort Betty greatly.
What was more likely than that Eva, venturing too
near the river, might have slipped in, and that Jack
and she had drowned together in his effort to save her.
and were they caught in the fire in the bush their
fate would be no less horrible!  The fear, kept to
herself, was too terrible to bear.
</p>

<p>
"I'm frightened," she said, trying to smile off her
terror.  "I feel as if something frightful had
happened to the children."
</p>

<p>
"It's scarcely like you to give way to nerves,"
Tom said with a smile.  "You go along the road
for a little way, and I will follow on by the river
bank.  Cooey when you want me to come back;"
but he could not smother his own anxiety as he
scrambled along.
</p>

<p>
Presently he heard a long cooey, and cooeyed an
answer with a sense of triumph.
</p>

<p>
"And here we've been full of fears, like a couple
of grandmothers, and she's found them coming back
like a pair of puppies, a little ashamed of themselves
for having run away," he said, with a joyous little
laugh, but it was Betty alone he saw crossing the
bridge when he arrived there.
</p>

<p>
"I thought surely you were bringing them with you."
</p>

<p>
"I've found&mdash;this," Betty said, holding out a
large white ribbon bow.  "It's Eva's bow."
</p>

<p>
"And where?"
</p>

<p>
"At the turning which leads to the bush."
</p>

<p>
Their eyes met for a moment.  "That, at any rate,
gives us some clue as to where to look for them.  We
ought to be thankful for the bow and its message."
</p>

<p>
"What message?" asked Betty.
</p>

<p>
"That they are safe somewhere, I feel certain of
it.  I was more frightened by the river than the
bush.  Strayed children can be found."
</p>

<p>
The sound of wheels from behind them made
them look round, and they saw that already some
of their party were on their homeward way.
</p>

<p>
"What are you about, you two?" said the man,
drawing rein with a good-natured laugh.  "Tea
will be over and done with before you get back.
I've got to be back with my missus to look after the
farm.  I'd advise you to hurry up if you don't want
to miss your rations," and before they could answer,
or explain the cause of their delay, he had whipped
up his horses and had passed on his way, the grating
sound of the brakes dying out in the distance.
</p>

<p>
"We must get back and tell them," said Betty,
"and then we must set about a systematic search.
I'm thankful those people did not stop to learn
what was the matter."
</p>

<p>
Neither spoke as they hurried back to their
companions.  Clarissa Kenyon's terror when she heard
the children were lost was absolutely ungovernable
in its expression.
</p>

<p>
"Lost!" she cried.  "And you two stand here
and do nothing?"
</p>

<p>
She tried to get on to her feet, but the pain in her
ankle made her sink back into her seat with a little
cry.
</p>

<p>
"We will do all we can," said Tom quietly, "and
we have some little clue in Eva's ribbon."
</p>

<p>
Clarissa snatched it from him, and covered it
with kisses.
</p>

<p>
"Joseph's coat, Joseph's coat," she said wildly.
"Some evil has befallen the child as it had befallen
him.  Ah! what will become of me if I am to lose
her?"
</p>

<p>
Betty knelt beside her with her arms round her.
</p>

<p>
"We must neither say it nor think it," she said.
"Your brother and I and one or two others are off
in search of them.  Mother, will you and Clarissa
go home?  It's quite impossible that you can stay
here."
</p>

<p>
"I shall stay whatever happens," said Clarissa.
"Is it likely I shall go whilst Eva's fate hangs in the
balance?"
</p>

<p>
"But it doesn't hang," said a husky voice from
behind.  "It's because I knew you'd be in such a
funk about her that I've come," and there advanced
into the circle a boy with grimed face and torn
clothes that only those who knew him best could
recognize as Jack.
</p>

<p>
"Jack!  Jack!" cried Betty, throwing her arms
about him, and her enormous feeling of relief found
vent in hysterical laughter.
</p>

<p>
Questions poured in on the boy from every side.
</p>

<p>
"Where had he come from, where was Eva?"
etc., but Tom, watching Jack's face paling under
its grime, knew him fairly played out.
</p>

<p>
"Eva is with Jessie," was all he could gasp out,
and he would have fallen to the ground but that
Tom's arms caught him and laid him down gently on
a bed of fern.
</p>

<p>
"Give him air and space and a drink of water.
His story can wait till later.  It's enough to know
they are safe."
</p>

<p>
Tom's intervention saved Jack from fainting,
and in a few minutes he was able to relate what had
occurred.
</p>

<p>
"And when Eva was put to bed," he said, "I ran
off to join the beaters, but I found the fire had swept
on, taking a different course, so there was no need
for further alarm.  Then I sneaked off on my own
to see if there was a chance of getting back to you,
and I got through somehow."
</p>

<p>
"Came through the bush?" said Tom.  "It was
a horrible risk."
</p>

<p>
"But someone had to come, and I found a place
where the fire had not caught on much, and I made
a dash for it and dodged it, racing from tree to tree.
No, I've not a burn on me.  The soles of my boots are
scorched and my clothes half off my back, because
I could not stop to pick my way, and the fire had
only penetrated quite a narrow way into the bush.
The puzzle was when I came to the far side of it to
find the track.  I should have been here quicker
else."
</p>

<p>
"But you found it all right at last."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I found it safe enough.  That's why I
wanted to get off whilst it was daylight.  Even with
a moon I should have lost my way."
</p>

<p>
"But what of those left behind?"
</p>

<p>
Jack made a little grimace.  "I never thought of
them, only of you, but it's different, isn't it?  Eva's
all right.  She'll sleep as sound as a top till the
morning, and for the rest, I don't belong to them as
I do to Aunt Betty."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said Clarissa Kenyon, seizing one of
Jack's hands, and laying her soft cheek against it.
"They will only wonder vaguely what has become
of you, but my heart was breaking, Jack, breaking
with the fear that I had lost my little Eva.  God
bless you for bringing me the news of her safety."
</p>

<p>
Jack drew away his hand uneasily as her tears fell
on it, and tried to rub it clean.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Jack, come down to the river and
have a wash and a comb up before we start for home,"
said Aunt Betty, in her matter-of-fact way, but Jack
never guessed that her heart was thumping against
her ribs with joy and pride in the boy who was ready
to go through fire or water if he thought that duty
demanded it of him, and her pride found its lawful
expression later when she found herself alone with
Tom for a minute.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered with quiet satisfaction.  "He
promises to turn into a boy that his father will be
proud of one day."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br /><br />
GOING HOME
</h3>

<p>
"Jack," called Betty, a few days afterwards, "come
in a minute.  I want to speak to you."
</p>

<p>
Jack passed in rapid review his conduct of the last
few days, and decided that there was nothing Aunt
Betty could want to lecture him about, and yet the
brevity of the summons sounded like the preface to
a lecture.  He came up the paddock rather
reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, joining her in the verandah, but
not sitting down.  "Don't keep me long, there's a
dear.  I'm making an aeroplane, and it's
frightfully exciting."
</p>

<p>
"But I think the news I have for you will be
frightfully exciting too," she said smiling at him.
</p>

<p>
Jack's eyes shone like stars.  "Is it that father's
coming?"
</p>

<p>
Betty's heart smote her that she had raised the
boy's hope so high only to dash it again.
</p>

<p>
"Not quite so exciting as that, but something
that will get you more ready to go to England.
Father wants you to go to school in Melbourne, a
boys' school that Uncle Tom knows about, and
thinks a good one.  Father is very anxious that you
should be working hard now so that you will be
able to take your place with other boys of your
age when you go home."
</p>

<p>
Jack seized his cap from his head and sent it
spinning into the air with a whoop of triumph.
</p>

<p>
"I should say it just was exciting!  Why, Aunt
Betty, it's glorious."
</p>

<p>
His delight was so natural, that Betty would not
dim it by any expression of personal regret.  Besides,
although she did not tell Jack this, his father's
decision was the result of her own advice.  She
did not consider that the experiment of sending him
to the State school had answered.  He was too
well known to every boy in the place, and was
contracting acquaintances she did not care for him
to make, and imitating follies that were by no means
harmless, and she believed a complete change of
companionship would be better for him and for
his progress in learning.  She knew that Captain
Stephens was making not only a name but some
money by his inventive skill and mastership of
aircraft, and that it was his full intention to give
Jack a good education, so she had written some
months back suggesting the change of school and
saying that she believed her influence over Jack
stood a better chance of making itself felt when he
was away from her and constantly in need of her
than now, when more than half his time was spent
out of her sight, and when her presence at home
was so completely a matter of course that he scarcely
realised its value.  And from Jack's father had
come an entirely reassuring answer.  No mother
could have his little son's interests more entirely
at heart than Betty, and he was quite willing to accept
her judgment, and that of the man who had acted
the part of a kind and wise elder brother to Jack, and
to send him to the school Tom Chance recommended.
</p>

<p>
"And you need not worry about ways and means.
Let Jack have a proper school outfit.  You will
know what he needs better than I.  It was certainly
my wish at first that he should remain with you
at all hazards until I could come and fetch him, but
the time has been longer than I at first expected, and
I quite see the force of your argument that he shall
be able to take his proper standing with other boys
of his age on his return, and possibly the education
of a State school would hardly prepare him for this.
Is it asking too much that Tom Chance will keep an
eye to him as regards religious matters?  A boy's
first plunge into school life is an important era in
his life.  I'm not sure that Mr. Chance is still in
the colony, but if you are in touch with him tell
him what I feel about it."
</p>

<p>
All this was running through Betty's mind as
she listened to Jack's outpouring of delight.
</p>

<p>
"And when am I going, Aunt Betty?"
</p>

<p>
"Next term if you can be taken in.  I've already
written to the head-master about you, for this has
been in our heads for some time, although I could not
mention it to you until I knew father's decision.
Now I see no reason why you should not travel
back to Melbourne under Uncle Tom's care."
</p>

<p>
Jack fairly danced with joy.
</p>

<p>
"I'm off, Aunt Betty; I'm off to find Uncle
Tom, and to tell Eva.  She'll mind rather much,
I fancy, but I'll tell her she can write to me if she
likes, and I'll answer as I get time," and away he
flew, leaving Betty half amused and half heart-sore.
</p>

<p>
"A budding lord of creation," she said to Tom
later in the day when he came to talk matters over
with her.
</p>

<p>
"Women and girls find their right place in looking
after him."
</p>

<p>
The words were playful, but there was an under-lying
sadness in them.
</p>

<p>
"It's partly the fault of the women and the girls
who spoil boys and men, isn't it?  But there's
scarcely one amongst us but owns in his secret
heart that all that is noble in him he owes to the
influence of some good woman&mdash;a mother, a sister,
or an aunt&mdash;and Jack, come to man's estate, will look
back and call Aunt Betty's name blessed."
</p>

<p>
Tears stood in Betty's eyes, but her smile was sweet
and tender.
</p>

<p>
"If that prophecy comes true, I shall consider
that life has been worth living," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Let us hope that there may be other causes by
that time which will make your life very much worth
living; others who will need you even more than
little Jack, a husband, perhaps, and&mdash;children of
your own."
</p>

<p>
The colour mounted to Betty's face flooding it
from brow to chin, then faded leaving her deadly
pale.  Tom was standing over her looking down on
her with a smile that told her more clearly than any
words that he loved her, that the husband his
imagination pictured was himself.
</p>

<p>
"Betty," he said, using her Christian name for
the first time, "I did not mean to speak yet.  I
meant to wait until I am recalled to England and
have a likelihood of a home to offer you, but your
regret at losing your Jack led me on.  Should I do,
can you think of me as the husband?  Betty, my
dear, my whole heart cries out to you, I love you so.
I don't know when it began, but I almost think it
was the first day we ever met, and you caught me
at cricket.  It will be the biggest blow of my life
if you catch me out now.  Betty, my sweet one, what
answer will you give me?  My whole happiness hangs
on it.  Is it yes, or no?"
</p>

<p>
Betty looked into his face with a tremulous smile,
put out her hands to him, and the next moment
was clasped in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"My darling," he said, as he reverently kissed her,
"you shall never have cause to regret your decision."
</p>

<p>
In the first few moments of their tumultuous
happiness neither wished to speak; it was enough
for Betty to feel Tom's arm round her, and to know
that she was his for evermore, his helpmeet, sharing
his home and work, the one man in the world she
had ever loved, for a pretty helpful girl like Betty
had had other men who wished to marry her, but
not one of them had even set her pulses beating, much
less suggested himself as her husband, but now she
had entered her kingdom!  Was ever girl quite as
happy as she was at this moment?
</p>

<p>
Later on they talked of their future.  Tom had
mapped out work that would take him about two
years to carry through, and then he meant to go
home.
</p>

<p>
"And you will come with me, Betty darling,
come with me as my wife," he said joyously.  "I
wonder if you realise what you are doing in marrying
me.  It's rather like catching a lark and shutting
it up in a close dark cage, for my work will lie in
some slum parish probably, where sorrow and sin
will close you in on every side, and after your free
country-life out here, you will feel choked by it
often and often."
</p>

<p>
"I daresay I shall, but&mdash;I shall have you," said
Betty, simply.  "Shall we go and tell mother?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Treherne's consent was a foregone
conclusion, and separation from their only daughter
being as yet a thing in the distance, left them free
now to rejoice in her happiness.  Ted's congratulations
when he came in from the farm were rather less
hearty.
</p>

<p>
"It's rather a mean trick to play," he said.  "You
had all England to choose from, and you come out
here and want to carry off our Betty, and there's
not a girl who can hold a candle to her in all the
colony, is there, mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Not one," said Mrs. Treherne, giving the hand
she held a squeeze.
</p>

<p>
"And that's the very reason why I want to take
her home when the time comes," said Tom with
a happy laugh.  "I want them to see the kind of
girl the colony can produce.  I don't underrate
her, Ted."
</p>

<p>
"I won't stay and be discussed as if I wasn't
here," said Betty, blushing a little.  "Ought not
we to go and see Clarissa, Tom?" so they walked off
together down the paddock, hand-in-hand.
</p>

<p>
"And that's how they'll walk off one day for good
and all," said Ted, watching them moodily from
the verandah.  "Hang it all, mother.  I wonder you
can take it so quietly.  Why can't she marry some
man in the colony, and stay in the land she belongs
to?  They will only look down upon her in
England," but that fired Mrs. Treherne into speech.
</p>

<p>
"Look down on her!  Look down on my Betty!
Isn't it because I know that to Tom she is the one
woman in all the world that I give my consent to
his carrying her away?  But don't rub it in, Ted,"
and her tone was a little weary.  "She's not going
yet for a year or two, and every mother has to face
the fact that the young ones she has reared and loved
will fly off sometime and make nests of their own.
It's God's law, and there is no escaping it."
</p>

<p>
Ted bent and brushed his bronzed cheek against
hers.
</p>

<p>
"No fear, mother.  There's one who will stick
by the old birds, and keep their nest warm and dry
for them," he said gruffly, and stirred by an unusual
emotion he strolled off to the farm and solaced
himself with a pipe.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile no explanations were necessary with
Clarissa.  She just glanced at the smiling faces,
saw the clasped hands, and burst into a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"So it's settled at last," she said, her own hands
closing over their clasped ones, "but the wonder
to me is why you have been so long about it, for
you've known your own minds long enough.
Betty, my dear, you're a lucky woman."
</p>

<p>
"As if I didn't know it," protested Betty, as
Clarissa kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"But I remember your telling me almost the
first night I came that you should like a sister just
like Betty," Tom grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"So I did, so I do, but all the same I call her a
lucky sister in marrying you," and with that
assertion Betty was well content.
</p>

<p>
"Shall you tell the children?" Clarissa asked
later.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes," Betty said.  "I never see the use of
making mysteries out of things that are clear and
true as daylight, and to Jack it will make no
difference.  He claimed Tom as his uncle long ago.
Where are they, Clarissa?  Jack rushed off here in
great excitement to tell the news of his going to
school, and I have not seen him since."
</p>

<p>
"They are in the garden, I think.  Eva is full
of lamentation that she was not born a boy, so that
she might go to school with Jack, but he comforts
her by reminding her that she would be in a lower
form, and would see little of him!"
</p>

<p>
"He's a little beyond himself; he'll come back
to his bearings directly," Tom said.  "It's the first
event of importance that has come to him.  Come,
Betty; we will find them."
</p>

<p>
They sat side by side in the swing, their heads
close together deep in conversation, but at sight
of Aunt Betty and Tom, Jack sprang to the ground
and came rushing towards them.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom, has Aunt Betty told you?  Do
you know I'm going to school?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know that and something else which
makes me very glad, happier than I've ever been in
all my life."
</p>

<p>
"What?" asked Jack and Eva in chorus.
</p>

<p>
"That some day, when I go home, Aunt Betty
will marry me, and go home with me as my wife.
That's a big bit of news, isn't it, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
Eva laughed and clapped her hands, but Jack
stood looking from Tom to Aunt Betty, with a
slight air of bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
"Then she'll stay with you for ever and ever?"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"I hope so, Jack," said Tom, with a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"And you'll be my real uncle, not a pretence
one?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Tom again.
</p>

<p>
"Then I'm jolly glad, and oh, Aunt Betty,"
fresh light dawning on him, "it will mean that
I'll have you always too the same as I do now.  I
think I'm almost as glad as Uncle Tom," and
forgetful of his boyish dignity his arms closed round
her neck in a rapturous hug, and Betty, as she held
him fast, felt no congratulation on her engagement
was quite so dear and sweet as his.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The days would have dragged heavily after Jack's
departure but for the new great happiness which
filled Betty's heart to overflowing.  Tom had
taken Jack to school and installed him there, a
very good school Tom told her, with a wholesome
religious basis, where "Jack will get such teaching
as you and his father would wish him to have,"
Tom wrote, and Betty was content in this, as in
all things, to rely upon Tom's judgment.
</p>

<p>
Months passed by, Jack came for his first holidays
full of his school-mates, and, what pleased Betty
more, very full of his work.
</p>

<p>
He was developing rather an extraordinary turn
for mathematics and mechanics, and spent most of
his recreation time in the workshop attached to
his school, intent upon models of various sorts, and
Betty rejoiced and sympathised with his hobby.  It
was all helping to get him ready for his future work.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, as the months ran into years, Betty
went on quite quietly and contentedly with her
own work&mdash;her preparations for her marriage
which she now knew not to be far distant.  Had
not Tom said he would come to fetch her in about
two years?  The dainty garments she fashioned
were finished one by one and laid by in a box which
she named her glory box.
</p>

<p>
"For it is a glory, mother, to be loved by a man
like Tom," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Then my gift shall be the household linen,"
said Mrs. Treherne, and side by side with the glory
box there stood a large chest which received
Mrs. Treherne's contributions as they were folded and
marked in readiness for Betty's marriage.
</p>

<p>
And true to his promise when the two years were
nearly completed Tom wrote a letter, almost
incoherent in its happiness, to tell her he was coming
to claim his own.
</p>

<p>
"I shall bring Jack along with me, for, as you
know, his holidays will be due, and the dear boy is
looking forward with sober happiness to his
Confirmation day.  I always promised to be present at
it if I were still in the Colony, and the Bishop, I
hear, holds one at Wallaroo about the 21st of
December.  Jack's preparation has been a careful
one, and by his letters to me I think his mind is
fully made up to continue Christ's faithful soldier
and servant unto his life's end.  He had his choice
of being confirmed in the cathedral at Melbourne,
when some other lads from his school received the
laying on of hands, but he wrote that he would
rather wait for the Confirmation in his own little
church at home, 'when you and Aunt Betty will
be there with me.'  I thought it sweet of the boy,
but, indeed, my Betty, I think Jack will turn into
a boy you will have every cause to be proud of."
</p>

<p>
And the post which brought that letter brought
another which was almost as important.  Jack's
father was coming to take his boy home; indeed,
within a week of the letter's departure he would
be on his way.  Pressure of business would make his
stay in the colony a short one, "but I always
promised Jack to come and fetch him, and I will keep
my word."
</p>

<p>
He gave the name of the liner in which his passage
was taken, and the date when she was due at Melbourne.
</p>

<p>
"But mother&mdash;it's too delightful," said Betty,
looking up from the letter.  "Jack's father is coming
and is due in Melbourne on the 18th or 19th of
December.  By good luck he should be here on
Jack's Confirmation day.  Won't it be beautiful
if he is?"
</p>

<p>
And through the coming weeks Betty lived on
in happy expectation, wondering what she had
done to deserve such happiness.  Jack was coming,
and Jack's father, and, what was greater still, her
own Tom, from whom, God willing, she would never
again be separated.
</p>

<p>
Clarissa had clamoured to make her her wedding
gown, but Betty asserted she did not mean to
have one.
</p>

<p>
"Tom and I are of one mind," she said.  "We
think the greatest and holiest day of our lives shall
not be desecrated by flutter and fuss.  I'll be married
in a coat and skirt, a white one if you prefer it,
and we mean to have no fuss of any kind, and we
want only those present who love us, and will say
their prayers for us.  We have not yet settled the
day, but it will be pretty soon after he comes,
for he has marching orders to return to England.
He means to take our passages for about the end of
the year.  Don't you wish you were coming too?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't," said Clarissa, vehemently.  "I
love this place and its kind, warm-hearted people,
and I love your father and mother, and mean to
make up your loss to them as far as I can.  I know
it will be very imperfectly accomplished, but just
think of the desolation which will be theirs when
you've left them for good, gone out of their reach,
Betty."
</p>

<p>
Tears stood in Betty's eyes.  "Yes, I know,
and often I wonder at myself for doing it, and
yet&mdash;it's not that I love them less than I ever did,
that I don't know what I'm leaving behind me,
but if Tom were going to the uttermost parts of
the earth I feel my call to go with him.  I love
him better than life itself, Clarissa.  Don't you
know what I mean?"
</p>

<p>
Clarissa was very white.  "Yes, I loved George
like that, but, unlike you, I married without the
sanction of my father, and I never felt that God's
blessing followed me as it will follow you, my Betty,
going before and after like the pillar of cloud that
guided the Israelites.  It's because I love George
so dearly that I don't want to go home.  I want
to live and die in the country where we spent our
short married life together."
</p>

<p>
On the 16th of December Betty stood in her simple
white gown waiting at the corner of the green lane
for the evening coach that was to bring Tom and
Jack from the station, and as she heard the rattle of
the wheels and the sound of the galloping horses
breasting the hill, her own heart beat in joyful
sympathy, for her happiness was close at hand.
And almost before the coach stood still, Tom and
Jack had jumped from their seats on the top, and
were taking her eagerly between them up the green
lane towards the farm.
</p>

<p>
"But, Jack, you grow by feet, not by inches,"
said Betty, putting him a little away from her
that she might see him more distinctly.  "Father
will feel quite shy of you."
</p>

<p>
"More than I'll be of him, then.  Do you see
he's won a medal for his last invention, Aunt Betty?
Isn't he glorious?  The boys at school chaff me
because they say I'm always boasting about father,
and I tell them they would boast too if they had
a father like him to boast about.  Why, there's
Eva, waiting at the gate.  I'll just run on and have
a word with her."
</p>

<p>
Then Tom and Betty were left alone, and took
a long look into each other's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Well, darling!  Are you ready for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite ready.  Have I not said so often enough."
</p>

<p>
"And you will marry me any day I like?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mother knows we both wish it to be as
quiet as possible, to have no splash breakfast, not
even a wedding cake."
</p>

<p>
"Then I've settled it," said Tom joyously.
"I saw the Bishop at Launceston and he's kind
enough to express a wish to perform the Service.
The Confirmation is to be quite early in the morning
of the twenty-first and if you could fix the wedding
to take place immediately after it, it would be
delightful.  It's short notice, but will it suit you,
my darling?  The time has dragged just lately
Your face, your dear face, has come between me
and my work.  We've been pretty patient, I think.
Will your mother object?"
</p>

<p>
"The time will suit me, and I don't think
mother will object," said Betty, slipping her hand
into his.  "She is prepared for us to sail about the
end of the year.  She knows the parting is quite
close; sometimes I think the strain tells on her.
It will be better for her when it's over.  We needn't
tell anyone, Tom.  We'll be married and slip away
somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"To Melbourne," said Tom, "or we'll keep our
Christmas at Launceston and your luggage can
follow us there."
</p>

<p>
"And it's a good time in a way for us to be going,
for Jack's father will be here and take away the
bitterness of the parting.  He will be following us
soon to England."
</p>

<p>
"Betty, are you afraid, afraid to trust yourself
to me all that long distance from home?  It's
a tremendous trust you give me."
</p>

<p>
Betty turned her face, glorified by love, to his.
</p>

<p>
"Afraid! with <i>you</i>, Tom!" and Tom was satisfied.

CHAPTER XIII
<br /><br />
TWO VENTURES OF HOPE
</h3>

<p>
It was the evening before Jack's confirmation
and Tom's and Betty's wedding day.  Up and
down the paddock paced Tom and Jack, arm in arm,
and Tom's heart was almost as full of the boy who
gripped his arm as of the fair woman whom he
would call wife on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
"It will be a great day for us both, Jack," he said,
giving expression to his thought.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Uncle Tom."
</p>

<p>
"Your whole life may depend upon your decision."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it's rather awful when you come to think
of it."
</p>

<p>
"It would be if you did not feel sure that the
hosts of God, that God Himself is behind you."
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Tom, I want to grow into just such a man
as you."
</p>

<p>
"Ah no," said Tom quickly.  "There is but
one model for us all to copy, the man Christ Jesus."
</p>

<p>
Jack's heart was too full to answer.
</p>

<p>
"I do wish father could have got here in time,"
he said, wistfully.
</p>

<p>
"Aunt Betty thinks he will appear some time
to-morrow, but she does not think it possible that
he can arrive in time for the service."
</p>

<p>
"I heartily wish he could for all our sakes.  Aunt
Betty is almost as keen as you, for she longs to get
a glimpse of him before I carry her off.  We leave
for Launceston in the afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"It would be just beastly if I did not know that
I shall see you both in England in a few months'
time; but now I shall have father, and going about
with him all the time, I shan't be able to miss
anyone very much.  I wish girls didn't cry.  Whenever
I talk of going to England, Eva cries or blows her
nose to prevent it!  Men aren't made like that,
are they?  It would be horrid if they were!  I
always tell her to dry up, and perhaps some day,
when I'm a man, I'll come out and marry her."
</p>

<p>
Tom laughed out loud; it was rather refreshing
to find that the boy at his side, so manly in some
ways, was still at heart as innocent as a child.
</p>

<p>
"But Eva might have found someone else to
marry by that time," he suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course if she did it would be all right,
and she would not want me," said Jack, nonchalantly,
in no way affected at the thought of the
loss of his ladylove.  "She has cheered up a bit
since Aunt Betty has consented to her being bridesmaid,
although she's not to be dressed up fine, just
a new white frock and a white muslin hat, she says."
</p>

<p>
Then Aunt Betty's voice, ringing down the paddock,
called them both in to supper.
</p>

<p>
The little church was full to overflowing on the
morrow, for quick as had been the final choice of
the wedding day the rumour of it had spread
like fire through the township, and loving hands
had been busy on the previous afternoon, decorating
the tiny sanctuary with Madonna lilies and other
white flowers for the double service.  And all had
been carried through so quickly and quietly that
no one at the farm knew anything of it.
</p>

<p>
It was only a handful of candidates that were
presented for Confirmation, not more than a score,
but of those it may be said that the present Vicar
had spent much time and prayer on their preparation.
The candidates were ranged in the front seats, and
quite at the back of the church was seated the party
from the farm, with Clarissa and Eva, and the
intervening benches were filled with neighbours from the
township.  The only one who had come from a
distance was Jessie Butler, who hearing that her friend
of earlier years was to be confirmed, and remembering
his presence at her own confirmation, had come to
stay a night or two with someone in Wallaroo on
purpose to be present when Jack was confirmed.
</p>

<p>
The congregation rose simultaneously to its feet
as the Bishop, preceded by the Vicar, appeared
from the tiny vestry, and the service began with a
hymn, during the singing of which the rather
unusual sound of a motor driving at full speed and
brought to a sudden standstill outside the open
door of the little church, fell upon Betty's ear.
Could it be the sudden arrival of a belated candidate.
But creeping quietly into the church, her glad eyes
recognised Jack's father, standing hesitatingly in
the doorway.  He had motored all the way from
Launceston to be present at his son's Confirmation,
and Mr. Treherne, with a quick movement, motioned
him to Betty's side.  It was the one presence she
and Jack needed to make the day perfect in their
eyes.  And a great joy and thankfulness filled
the elder Jack's heart, as he recognised his tall
boy standing at the head of the row of boy
candidates, and heard his emphatic promise to renew
his baptismal promises and serve God manfully
for the rest of his life, and when it came to Jack's
turn to kneel before the Bishop and receive the
laying on of hands, Betty's hand sought for a
moment that of her brother-in-law, and together
they sank upon their knees and prayed very
fervently for God's blessing on the head of the boy
who was almost equally dear to both of them.
</p>

<p>
The Bishop's charge was a very simple one, but
the earnest words could scarcely fail to reach the
hearts of all who listened to them, and a reverent
hush fell on the congregation as he pronounced
the blessing.  And then there was a pause for those
who wished to leave the church, but not one stirred
from his place.  They waited for what was to follow.
Then Tom, with a glance at Betty, moved to the
chancel steps to be followed immediately by Betty,
leaning on her father's arm, while little Eva with
round wondering eyes took her place behind, and
forthwith the wedding service proceeded.  Jack's
father, meanwhile, had walked up the church and
taken his own place by his son.
</p>

<p>
Then, in low clear voices, fully audible to all
present, Tom and Betty spoke out their promises
to be true and loyal to each other as long as life
should last.  There were those in the congregation
who beforehand had grumbled that such an unusual
event as a wedding should be carried through
in what they were pleased to call such a hole-and-corner
fashion, but criticism vanished when the
simply attired bride came down the church upon
her husband's arm.  All felt the bright-faced bride
was in her right setting.
</p>

<p>
The Bishop, after shaking hands with the wedding
couple, had to hurry off for another function, and
then the wedding party walked quietly back to the
farm, where a meal, laid in readiness beforehand,
awaited them.  Jack sat by his father and Tom and
Betty were placed in the centre of the table.  Just
at the end of the meal, Mr. Treherne rose to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"God bless my girl, as good a daughter as ever
stepped, and God bless the man she has married,"
was all he said, and Betty turned and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
The last half hour before the buggy came round
to carry them to the station was spent by Betty in
her mother's room.  What passed between them
none knew, but when Betty came out in her neat
travelling dress, there were traces of tears in her
eyes.  Then came the hubbub of adieus, and more
farewells had to be spoken at the gate of the paddock,
where half the township had gathered to wish the
bride and bridegroom farewell.  Missiles of all
description had been tabooed, but the kindly cheers
of her neighbours, the eager outstretched hands
which grasped hers, were a lovely ending to a happy
life, thought Betty, as she drove off with her
husband at her side.  For she fully realised that one
page of her life was folded down, but another page,
very fair and white, was spread out before her.
</p>

<p>
What shall be written upon it is not for us to say.
Some blots will surely blister it.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Into each life some rain must fall,<br />
  Some days must be dark and dreary."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But now as Betty drives away with sunshine in
her face and sunshine in her heart, we breathe the
prayer that such days will be few and far between.

EPILOGUE
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<i>Extract from an English daily paper five years later.</i>
</p>

<p>
"Special mention should be made of the amazing
exhibition of prowess on the part of Lieutenant
Stephens in yesterday's military aeronautic
manoeuvres on Salisbury Plain.  His aeroplane, the
combined creation of his father and himself, is of
such perfect construction that it is likely to make
their name famous, and the Lieutenant's command
of it left nothing to be desired.  He executed
feats of skill which have rarely been surpassed.
England has just cause for pride in her present race
of young men, prepared to face every danger in the
service of their country, for it is an open secret
that upon the efficiency of our air fleet, the future
safety of our island home will very largely depend."
</p>

<p>
This paper, with others, was forwarded in due
time to Mrs. Kenyon, who read aloud the paragraph
just quoted to Eva, now a blooming girl of seventeen.
She flew round the table and snatched it from
her mother's hands.
</p>

<p>
"Let me read it for myself, mother.  We shall
all feel proud of him.  He's playing our childish
game of subduing giants to some purpose, isn't
he?  He's fairly earned his rights to his title of
'Jack, the Englishman.'  I'm ever so glad.  I'll
run across to the farm and tell them about it."
</p>

<p>
Clarissa laughed at the girl's enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"They are perfectly certain to have these papers
as well as ourselves.  Isn't he their grandson?"
</p>

<p>
"And a grandson to be proud of!  I wish he were
mine, or a brother or something.  Oh mother!
I wonder&mdash;Shall we ever see him again?"
